I will provide zip files which contains folders of lots of md files.
For each md file, I want you to run three layers of nested for loop and updated the md file. The task is actually quite mechinical and simple for you. The md file has several heading levels.
1. I will use #, ##, ### only. So, you can think of three layers of for loop. First layer is #, second is ##, and finally the last third layer is ###.
2. The first layer for the heading level # loop should have a title. The title should starts with no number and short for nav. However, the title should make sense, not like First, Second, and so on.
3. The second layer for the heading level ## loop should have a title. The title should starts with no number and short for nav. However, the title should make sense, not like First, Second, and so on.
4. The last third layer for the heading level ### loop should have a title. This time the title naming has a little twist that the title should starts with numbers like 1., 2., 3., and short for nav. However, the title should make sense, not like First, Second, and so on.
5. Remember the title with #, ##, or ### should be short (at most 20 characters includinh empty space) for nav one line and should make sense.
