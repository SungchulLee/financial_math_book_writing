# When Models Fail

Quantitative models are indispensable in modern finance, but history repeatedly shows that **models can and do fail**, often in systematic ways.

---

## 1. Sources of model failure

Models fail due to:
- incorrect assumptions,
- regime changes,
- extreme events outside calibration data,
- feedback effects created by model usage itself.

Failures are often structural, not accidental.

---

## 2. Historical examples

Notable failures include:
- Long-Term Capital Management (1998),
- Gaussian copula misuse in credit markets,
- volatility targeting during crises,
- liquidity assumptions in stress periods.

These failures share common patterns.

---

## 3. Warning signs

Indicators of impending failure include:
- unexplained residuals,
- breakdown of hedging performance,
- parameter instability,
- growing model complexity to fit data.

Early detection is critical.

---

## 4. Lessons learned

Robust risk management requires:
- humility about model limits,
- stress testing beyond historical regimes,
- diversification across models and views.

Models should inform, not dictate, decisions.

## 5. Key takeaways

- All models are approximations.
- Failure is inevitable over long horizons.
- Awareness of limitations improves resilience.
