## What is an extreme scenario?


An extreme scenario involves:

- stressed liquidity conditions.

They often exceed historical extremes.

- historically inspired (e.g., 2008 crisis),
- hypothetical but economically motivated,
- regulator-prescribed.

Design requires judgment and economic insight.

## Portfolio impact


Extreme scenarios reveal:
- nonlinear payoff effects,
- hidden concentrations,
- tail dependence across assets.

They are especially important for derivatives portfolios.

## Governance and usage


Effective use requires:
- clear scenario narratives,
- senior management engagement,
- integration into risk limits and capital planning.

Scenarios should evolve with markets.

## Key takeaways
