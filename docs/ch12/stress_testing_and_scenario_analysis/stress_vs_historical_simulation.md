# Stress vs Historical Simulation


Stress testing and historical simulation are two complementary approaches to assessing portfolio risk. Understanding their differences is essential for robust risk management.

---

## Historical simulation


Historical simulation estimates risk by:
- reusing past market returns,
- assuming the past is representative of the future,
- avoiding parametric distributional assumptions.

It is simple and intuitive, but limited by the historical sample.

---

## Stress testing


Stress testing evaluates portfolio losses under **hypothetical or extreme scenarios**, often outside historical experience.

Key features:
- forward-looking,
- scenario-driven,
- focused on tail risk.

## Comparison


| Aspect | Historical Simulation | Stress Testing |
|------|----------------------|----------------|
| Data | Past observations | Hypothetical/extreme |
| Tail coverage | Limited | Explicit |
| Model dependence | Low | Moderate |
| Regulatory use | VaR/ES | Capital adequacy |

---

## Complementary roles


- Historical simulation captures typical market behavior.
- Stress testing probes vulnerabilities and nonlinearities.
- Both are needed for comprehensive risk control.

---

## Key takeaways


- Historical simulation is backward-looking.
- Stress testing is forward-looking.
- Stress tests reveal risks unseen in data.
