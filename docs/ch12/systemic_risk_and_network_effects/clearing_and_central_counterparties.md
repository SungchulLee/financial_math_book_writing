# Clearing and Central Counterparties


**Central Counterparties (CCPs)** play a key role in mitigating counterparty risk but also concentrate risk, creating new systemic considerations.

---

## Role of CCPs


CCPs interpose themselves between counterparties:
- becoming the buyer to every seller and vice versa,
- enforcing margining and default management,
- reducing bilateral counterparty risk.

They simplify exposure networks.

---

## Risk concentration


While CCPs reduce bilateral risk, they:
- concentrate risk in a few entities,
- become systemically important,
- require robust governance and capital.

CCP failure would have severe consequences.

---

## Margining and procyclicality


CCP margin requirements:
- increase during stress,
- can amplify liquidity demand,
- may contribute to fire sales.

Balancing resilience and procyclicality is challenging.

---

## Systemic assessment


Evaluating CCPs involves:
- stress testing extreme defaults,
- assessing interoperability risks,
- coordinating cross-border regulation.

CCPs are central to post-crisis reforms.

## Key takeaways


- CCPs reduce bilateral counterparty risk.
- They concentrate and transform systemic risk.
- Strong governance is essential.
