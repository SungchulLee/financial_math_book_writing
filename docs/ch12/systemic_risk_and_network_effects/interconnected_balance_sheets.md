# Interconnected Balance Sheets


Systemic risk arises when financial institutions are **interconnected** through balance sheets, contracts, and markets, so that distress at one entity can propagate to others.

---

## Sources of interconnectedness


Interconnections arise from:
- interbank lending and funding markets,
- derivatives and collateral chains,
- common asset holdings.

These links create channels for shock transmission.

---

## Balance-sheet amplification


Losses can be amplified through:
- leverage constraints,
- margin calls and fire sales,
- mark-to-market accounting.

Small shocks may trigger large system-wide effects.

---

## Network perspective


Viewing the system as a network:
- nodes represent institutions,
- edges represent exposures,
- topology affects resilience.

Dense networks can be robust or fragile depending on structure.

---

## Measurement challenges


Systemic exposure is hard to measure due to:
- opacity of bilateral exposures,
- dynamic rebalancing,
- feedback effects.

Stress tests often approximate these effects.

---

## Key takeaways


- Balance-sheet links transmit shocks.
- Leverage and margins amplify losses.
- Network structure matters for stability.
