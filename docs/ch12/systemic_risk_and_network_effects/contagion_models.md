# Contagion Models


**Contagion models** study how financial distress spreads across institutions through networks, markets, and behavioral channels.

---

## Types of contagion


Contagion can occur via:
- direct exposure losses,
- asset fire-sale externalities,
- information and confidence effects.

These mechanisms often interact.

---

## Network contagion models


Common modeling approaches include:
- default cascade models,
- threshold models on networks,
- clearing payment models (e.g., Eisenberg–Noe).

They focus on solvency and payment spillovers.

---

## Market-based contagion


Beyond balance sheets:
- correlated asset sales depress prices,
- liquidity dries up simultaneously,
- volatility spikes propagate stress.

Market contagion is fast and nonlinear.

---

## Policy implications


Contagion models inform:
- capital and liquidity requirements,
- macroprudential regulation,
- stress-testing design.

They motivate system-wide oversight.

---

## Key takeaways


- Contagion is multi-channel and nonlinear.
- Network models reveal hidden fragilities.
- Macroprudential tools target contagion risk.
