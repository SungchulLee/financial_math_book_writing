# Backtesting and Limits


**Backtesting** compares model predictions with realized outcomes, while **limits** translate model outputs into actionable risk controls.

---

## Purpose of backtesting


Backtesting evaluates:
- predictive accuracy,
- stability over time,
- adequacy of tail risk estimates.

It is essential for detecting model breakdowns.

---

## Common backtesting approaches


Typical tests include:
- VaR exceedance tests,
- ES backtests,
- exposure and PFE validation.

Statistical significance and economic relevance both matter.

---

## Risk limits


Risk limits define:
- maximum acceptable exposures,
- thresholds for escalation,
- triggers for risk mitigation.

Limits operationalize model outputs.

---

## Limit breaches


When limits are breached:
- causes must be investigated,
- management actions taken,
- models reassessed if needed.

Persistent breaches indicate model or strategy issues.

---

## Key takeaways


- Backtesting assesses model performance.
- Limits convert risk measures into controls.
- Breaches provide warning signals.
