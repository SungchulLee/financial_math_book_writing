# Model Validation

**Model validation** ensures that risk models are conceptually sound, correctly implemented, and fit for their intended purpose.

---

## 1. Objectives of model validation

Model validation aims to verify:
- theoretical consistency,
- numerical correctness,
- appropriateness for use cases.

Validation is independent from model development.

---

## 2. Components of validation

A comprehensive validation covers:
- model assumptions and limitations,
- data quality and preprocessing,
- implementation and numerical accuracy.

Each component can materially affect outputs.

---

## 3. Ongoing validation

Models must be reviewed regularly to:
- reflect market evolution,
- incorporate new products,
- respond to observed weaknesses.

Validation is a continuous process, not a one-off event.

---

## 4. Governance role

Independent validation functions:
- challenge model developers,
- document limitations,
- recommend controls and usage constraints.

Strong governance underpins credible risk management.

---

## 5. Key takeaways

- Validation ensures models are fit for purpose.
- Independence and documentation are essential.
- Continuous review is required.
