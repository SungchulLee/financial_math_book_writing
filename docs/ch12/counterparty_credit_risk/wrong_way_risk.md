# Wrong-Way Risk


In counterparty credit risk, **wrong-way risk (WWR)** occurs when exposure to a counterparty increases as the counterparty’s credit quality deteriorates.

---

## Definition


Wrong-way risk arises when:
- exposure and default probability are positively correlated,
- losses are amplified in stress scenarios.

It is a key driver of tail counterparty losses.

---

## Examples


Examples include:
- FX derivatives where currency depreciation weakens the counterparty,
- equity derivatives on the counterparty’s own stock,
- commodity trades with producers tied to commodity prices.

---

## Modeling challenges


Standard CCR models often assume independence between:
- market factors driving exposure,
- default intensity of the counterparty.

This assumption understates WWR.

---

## Practical treatment


WWR is addressed through:
- stressed exposure scenarios,
- explicit dependence between intensity and market factors,
- regulatory add-ons and conservative assumptions.

---

## Key takeaways


- Wrong-way risk magnifies CCR losses.
- Independence assumptions are dangerous.
- Stress-based approaches are essential.
