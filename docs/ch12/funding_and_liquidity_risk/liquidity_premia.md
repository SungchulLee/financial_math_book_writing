# Liquidity Premia


**Liquidity premia** compensate investors for the cost and risk of trading assets that cannot be bought or sold quickly without price impact.

## What is liquidity?


Liquidity reflects:
- transaction costs,
- market depth,
- speed of execution.

Illiquid assets command higher expected returns.

---

## Liquidity premia in prices


Liquidity premia arise because:
- investors require compensation for delayed liquidation,
- stressed markets amplify liquidity risk,
- funding and market liquidity interact.

Observed prices embed both risk and liquidity components.

---

## Measurement challenges


Liquidity premia are hard to observe directly because:
- they are intertwined with credit and risk premia,
- market conditions change rapidly,
- data is sparse in stressed periods.

Proxy measures are often used.

## Implications for valuation


Ignoring liquidity premia leads to:
- overvaluation of illiquid assets,
- underestimation of tail risk,
- poor stress-test performance.

Liquidity adjustments are increasingly incorporated in practice.

## Key takeaways


- Liquidity premia compensate for trading frictions.
- They vary across assets and time.
- Valuation must reflect liquidity conditions.
