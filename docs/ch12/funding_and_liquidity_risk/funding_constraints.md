# Funding Constraints


**Funding constraints** arise when institutions face limits or costs in raising capital to finance positions. These constraints materially affect pricing, risk management, and trading strategies.

## Nature of funding constraints


Funding constraints stem from:
- limited access to unsecured funding,
- collateral and margin requirements,
- balance-sheet and regulatory limits.

They bind most tightly during market stress.

## Impact on trading strategies


When funding is constrained:
- leveraged positions become costly,
- arbitrage opportunities may persist,
- risk-neutral pricing assumptions break down.

Funding considerations influence portfolio construction.

## Interaction with derivatives


For derivatives:
- variation margin reduces counterparty risk but increases funding needs,
- initial margin ties up liquidity,
- uncollateralized trades embed funding spreads.

These effects motivate funding-adjusted valuation.

## Modeling approaches


Common approaches include:
- funding spread add-ons,
- balance-sheet constraints in optimization,
- dynamic funding accounts in pricing models.

No single approach fully captures reality.

## Key takeaways


- Funding constraints limit arbitrage.
- They are state-dependent and procyclical.
- Ignoring them understates real-world risk.
