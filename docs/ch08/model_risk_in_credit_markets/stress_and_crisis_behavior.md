# Stress and Crisis Behavior

Credit models calibrated in normal markets often fail during **stress and crisis periods**. Understanding these breakdowns is central to credit model risk.

---

## 1. Regime dependence

During crises:
- default intensities jump,
- correlations spike,
- liquidity evaporates.

Static models cannot capture these regime shifts.

---

## 2. Model breakdown mechanisms

Common failure modes include:
- extrapolation beyond calibration data,
- frozen liquidity invalidating market prices,
- violated independence assumptions.

Models appear stable until stress occurs.

---

## 3. Stress testing

Robust credit risk management relies on:
- scenario analysis,
- extreme but plausible stresses,
- reverse stress testing.

Stress tests complement, not replace, models.

---

## 4. Lessons from crises

Historical crises show:
- tail risk dominates averages,
- diversification benefits vanish,
- conservative assumptions outperform complex models.

---

## 5. Key takeaways

- Crisis behavior differs qualitatively from normal markets.
- Stress testing is indispensable.
- Model humility is essential in credit markets.
