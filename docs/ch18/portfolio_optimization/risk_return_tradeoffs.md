# Risk-Return Trade-offs and the Geometry of the Efficient Frontier



The theory of optimal portfolio construction is anchored in the fundamental trade-off between risk and return. This relationship, which underlies the shape and structure of the efficient frontier, encapsulates the tension between investors' desire to maximize returns and their aversion to uncertainty. In this section, we provide a detailed exposition of the geometry of the efficient frontier, develop the analytical characterization of risk-return trade-offs under quadratic utility and mean-variance preferences, and examine the role of constraints in shaping the opportunity set.



## 1. The Mean-Variance Space



Let $\mu_P$ and $\\sigma_P$ denote the expected return and standard deviation of a portfolio, respectively. In the **mean-variance plane**, each admissible portfolio corresponds to a point $P = (\sigma_P, \mu_P)$. The **feasible set** is the collection of all such points generated by varying the portfolio weights $\mathbf{w}$ over the admissible set $\mathcal{W}$:

$$
F= \left\{ (\sigma_P, \mu_P) : \mu_P = \mathbf{w}^T \boldsymbol{\mu}, \; \sigma_P^2 = \mathbf{w}^T \boldsymbol{\Sigma} \mathbf{w}, \; \mathbf{w} \in \mathcal{W} \right\}
$$

The **efficient frontier**, $\mathcal{E} \subseteq \mathcal{F}$, is defined as the upper boundary of the feasible set—those portfolios for which there exists no other feasible portfolio with higher return and the same or lower risk.

## 2. Analytical Derivation of the Efficient Frontier





In the unconstrained case (i.e., full investment with unrestricted weights), the efficient frontier can be derived analytically via the method of Lagrange multipliers. Consider the constrained minimization problem:

$$
\min_{\mathbf{w}} \; \mathbf{w}^T \boldsymbol{\Sigma} \mathbf{w} \quad \text{subject to} \quad \mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{1} = 1, \; \mathbf{w}^T \boldsymbol{\mu} = \mu_0
$$

The solution yields the portfolio weights that minimize risk for a fixed target return $\mu_0$. Let us define the constants:

- $A = \mathbf{1}^T \boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{-1} \mathbf{1}$
- $B = \mathbf{1}^T \boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{-1} \boldsymbol{\mu}$
- $C = \boldsymbol{\mu}^T \boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{-1} \boldsymbol{\mu}$

The minimum variance for a given expected return $\\mu_0$ is then:

$$
\sigma^2(\mu_0) = \frac{A \mu_0^2 - 2B \mu_0 + C}{AC - B^2}
$$

This yields a **parametric equation** for the efficient frontier, which is a **parabola** in the $(\sigma_P, \mu_P)$ plane. The lower portion of the parabola corresponds to inefficient portfolios (offering lower return for the same risk) and is typically excluded in practical applications.



## 3. The Role of Constraints



While the unconstrained frontier provides valuable insights into the theoretical limits of risk-return optimization, real-world investment mandates often impose **non-negativity**, **budget**, or **group-level** constraints. The presence of constraints introduces **non-convexities** or restricts feasible directions in the weight space, thereby deforming the frontier.

Notably:

- **No short-selling constraints** (i.e., $w_i \geq 0$) eliminate the portion of the frontier that requires negative weights, truncating the lower-risk region.
- **Upper bounds** (e.g., $w_i \leq 0.1$) cap portfolio exposure, typically leading to less diversified and higher-risk solutions.
- **Cardinality constraints** introduce combinatorial complexity, potentially fracturing the frontier into disjoint regions.

Under these constraints, analytical derivation becomes infeasible, and one must rely on simulation or numerical optimization to trace the boundary of the attainable set.



## 4. Iso-Utility and Investor Preferences



In the mean-variance framework, investors are assumed to exhibit **risk aversion**, and their preferences can be represented by **indifference curves** (or iso-utility curves) of the form:

$$
U(\mu_P, \sigma_P) = \mu_P - \frac{1}{2} \lambda \sigma_P^2
$$

where $\lambda > 0$ is the investor’s risk aversion coefficient. Each curve corresponds to a set of portfolios that yield the same level of utility.

The **optimal portfolio** under this utility framework is found at the point of tangency between the investor’s highest attainable indifference curve and the efficient frontier. Increasing $\lambda$ leads to more risk-averse preferences, pushing the tangency point closer to the minimum variance portfolio.

This setup leads naturally to **quadratic programming**, in which the investor's objective becomes:

$$
\max_{\mathbf{w}} \; \mathbf{w}^T \boldsymbol{\mu} - \frac{1}{2} \lambda \mathbf{w}^T \boldsymbol{\Sigma} \mathbf{w}
$$

This yields a unique optimal portfolio for a given $\lambda$, assuming $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$ is positive definite.



## 5. Efficient Frontier with a Risk-Free Asset: The Capital Market Line



Introducing a risk-free asset with return $r_f$ fundamentally alters the geometry of the frontier. In this setting, any portfolio that combines the risk-free asset and a tangency portfolio lies on the **Capital Market Line (CML)**:

$$
\mu_P = r_f + \left(\frac{\mu_T - r_f}{\sigma_T}\right) \sigma_P
$$

This line represents the set of optimal portfolios under mean-variance utility when borrowing and lending at $r_f$ is allowed. The **tangency portfolio** $\mathbf{w}_T$ maximizes the Sharpe Ratio and is the only risky portfolio held by all investors under homogeneous expectations (per the CAPM assumptions).

The inclusion of a risk-free asset transforms the efficient frontier from a parabolic curve into a **linear frontier** that dominates all other combinations of risky assets in the absence of market frictions.



## Summary



In this section, we have explored the analytical and geometric foundations of the efficient frontier, examining its shape, curvature, and evolution under various constraints and assumptions. By framing portfolio optimization as a trade-off between return and risk, we formalized investor preferences using utility functions and demonstrated how convex optimization and linear combinations with a risk-free asset define the achievable set. The result is a comprehensive and flexible framework that connects the abstract theory of optimal portfolios with practical investment constraints, highlighting the interplay between utility maximization, market structure, and empirical modeling.
