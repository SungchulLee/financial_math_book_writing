# Human Judgment vs Automation

The increasing automation of financial decision-making raises the question of **how to balance human judgment and quantitative models**.

---

## 1. Strengths of automation

Automated models excel at:
- processing large datasets,
- enforcing discipline and consistency,
- reacting quickly to signals.

They reduce behavioral biases and execution delays.

---

## 2. Limits of automation

Automation struggles with:
- rare or unprecedented events,
- contextual and qualitative information,
- ethical and governance considerations.

Blind automation can amplify systemic risk.

---

## 3. Role of human judgment

Human judgment contributes:
- contextual understanding,
- scenario imagination,
- ethical oversight,
- intervention during model breakdowns.

Humans provide adaptability beyond algorithms.

---

## 4. Hybrid decision frameworks

Effective systems combine:
- model-driven recommendations,
- human review and override,
- clear escalation procedures.

This hybrid approach balances speed and wisdom.

---

## 5. Key takeaways

- Automation enhances efficiency but lacks judgment.
- Human oversight is essential.
- Robust systems integrate both.
