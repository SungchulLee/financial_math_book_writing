# Open Problems in Financial Mathematics


Despite decades of progress, many **open problems** remain at the frontier of financial mathematics and quantitative finance.

---

## Market microstructure and impact


Key open questions include:
- first-principles models of price formation,
- universal laws of market impact,
- interaction between microstructure and volatility.

Understanding these is central to modern markets.

---

## High-dimensional risk and dependence


Challenges remain in:
- modeling tail dependence,
- systemic risk quantification,
- scalable stress testing.

High dimensionality limits classical methods.

---

## Learning in adaptive markets


Open problems include:
- learning under endogenous feedback,
- guarantees in non-stationary environments,
- interaction between learning agents.

Theory lags practice in many areas.

---

## Robustness and uncertainty


Key questions involve:
- model uncertainty quantification,
- ambiguity-aware equilibrium models,
- robust calibration at scale.

Robustness remains an organizing principle.
