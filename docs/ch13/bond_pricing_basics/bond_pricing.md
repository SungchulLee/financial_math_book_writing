# Bond Pricing

##### Bonds price quote

$$\begin{array}{lll}
\text{corporate bonds}&\text{1/8 increments}\\
\text{government bills, notes, and bonds}&\text{1/32 increments}\\
\end{array}$$

You can see bonds prices quoted in 1/32th increments [here](https://www.bloomberg.com/markets/rates-bonds/government-bonds/us). As of 2011-10-23 you can see the 5 year note with a 1% coupon quoted with a price of "99-21¾" = 99 + 21.75/32 resulting in a yield of 1.07%.
