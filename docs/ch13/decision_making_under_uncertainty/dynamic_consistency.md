# Dynamic Consistency


**Dynamic consistency** ensures that decisions made under uncertainty remain coherent over time as information evolves.

---

## What is dynamic consistency?


A decision rule is dynamically consistent if:
- plans made today remain optimal tomorrow,
- preferences do not reverse over time,
- updated decisions align with prior intentions.

This is essential in multi-period settings.

---

## Issues under uncertainty


Under model uncertainty:
- different future selves may face different worst-case models,
- naive robust strategies may become time-inconsistent.

This creates planning paradoxes.

---

## Resolving inconsistency


Dynamic consistency can be restored by:
- rectangular (time-consistent) uncertainty sets,
- recursive preference formulations,
- dynamic programming principles.

These impose structure on ambiguity.

---

## Financial relevance


Dynamic consistency matters for:
- long-term portfolio management,
- pension and insurance problems,
- intertemporal risk management.

Inconsistent strategies are impractical.

---

## Key takeaways


- Dynamic consistency prevents preference reversals.
- Robust decisions require careful formulation.
- Time-consistent ambiguity models are essential.
