# Max–Min Expected Utility


**Max–min expected utility** is a foundational model for decision-making under ambiguity, capturing ambiguity-averse preferences when probabilities are not uniquely specified.

---

## Motivation


In many financial settings:
- probabilities are ambiguous,
- models are misspecified,
- decision-makers distrust a single reference measure.

Max–min utility reflects a cautious, worst-case attitude.

---

## Model formulation


Let \(\mathcal{P}\) be a set of plausible probability measures.
Preferences are defined by

\[
\max_{\pi} \; \min_{\mathbb{P} \in \mathcal{P}}
\mathbb{E}_{\mathbb{P}}[U(X^{\pi})].
\]



The decision-maker optimizes against the worst-case model.

## Economic interpretation


Max–min utility implies:
- extreme ambiguity aversion,
- conservative portfolio choices,
- endogenous model pessimism.

It generalizes classical expected utility.

---

## Financial implications


Applications include:
- portfolio choice under Knightian uncertainty,
- robust asset pricing,
- conservative risk management.

The approach often reduces leverage and risk-taking.

## Key takeaways


- Max–min utility captures ambiguity aversion.
- Decisions hedge against worst-case models.
- Robustness is prioritized over optimality.
