# Theoretical Impossibility Results

Beyond practical challenges, there are **theoretical limits** to what learning algorithms can achieve in financial markets.

---

## 1. No-free-lunch principles

No-free-lunch theorems state that:
- averaged over all data-generating processes,
- no learning algorithm outperforms others.

Assumptions drive performance, not algorithms alone.

---

## 2. Market efficiency arguments

Under strong forms of market efficiency:
- predictable excess returns cannot persist,
- learning algorithms cannot systematically outperform.

Any discovered pattern may vanish once exploited.

---

## 3. Adversarial and adaptive markets

In adaptive markets:
- strategies change the environment,
- learning induces feedback effects,
- convergence guarantees may fail.

This limits long-term learnability.

---

## 4. Implications for practice

Impossibility results imply:
- performance guarantees are fragile,
- humility is required in model claims,
- robustness matters more than optimality.

Learning must be combined with judgment.

## 5. Key takeaways

- There are fundamental limits to learning.
- Efficiency and adaptivity constrain predictability.
- Robust risk management dominates pure optimization.
