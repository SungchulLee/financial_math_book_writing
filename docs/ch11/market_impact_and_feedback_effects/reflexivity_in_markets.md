# Reflexivity in Markets

**Reflexivity**, a concept popularized by George Soros, describes the circular relationship between market participants’ beliefs and market outcomes.

---

## 1. Concept of reflexivity

Reflexivity posits that:
- beliefs influence actions,
- actions influence prices,
- prices reinforce beliefs.

Markets are thus self-referential systems.

---

## 2. Reflexivity vs equilibrium

In reflexive markets:
- equilibrium may not exist or be stable,
- expectations can be self-fulfilling,
- feedback dominates fundamentals.

This contrasts with rational expectations models.

---

## 3. Formal modeling approaches

Reflexivity can be modeled via:
- feedback control systems,
- agent-based models,
- learning and belief-updating frameworks.

These models emphasize dynamics over equilibrium.

## 4. Implications for finance

Reflexivity explains:
- bubbles and crashes,
- persistent mispricings,
- sudden market reversals.

It highlights limits of purely rational models.

---

## 5. Key takeaways

- Markets are reflexive systems.
- Beliefs and prices co-evolve.
- Feedback challenges equilibrium-based modeling.
