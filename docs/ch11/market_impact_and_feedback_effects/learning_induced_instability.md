# Learning-Induced Instability

When many agents adapt their strategies using similar learning rules, **learning-induced instability** can arise, amplifying volatility and systemic risk.

---

## 1. Adaptive strategies

Learning algorithms:
- update based on past performance,
- respond to observed market patterns,
- often share similar objectives.

Collective adaptation can destabilize markets.

---

## 2. Feedback amplification

Learning-induced effects include:
- crowded trades,
- self-reinforcing trends,
- sudden regime shifts.

Small signals can be amplified through learning feedback.

---

## 3. Examples

Examples include:
- volatility targeting strategies,
- trend-following algorithms,
- risk-parity portfolio adjustments.

These strategies can synchronize behavior.

---

## 4. Risk management implications

Learning-induced instability implies:
- non-linear risk amplification,
- failure of diversification,
- need for macroprudential oversight.

Models assuming independent agents are insufficient.

## 5. Key takeaways

- Adaptive learning can destabilize markets.
- Feedback loops amplify shocks.
- Stability requires diversity and constraints.
