# Equity–Credit Connection


Structural models naturally link **equity and credit markets** because both depend on the same underlying firm value process.

---

## Equity as a derivative on firm value


In structural models:
- equity is a residual claim,
- equity behaves like a call option,
- equity volatility reflects leverage.

This creates a tight theoretical equity–credit link.

---

## Credit spreads and equity signals


The model implies:
- falling equity prices → higher leverage → wider credit spreads,
- rising equity volatility → higher default probability.

This explains observed co-movements in markets.

---

## Practical applications


Structural insights are used for:
- credit spread forecasting,
- equity–credit relative value trades,
- stress testing and risk management.

Even reduced-form models often embed structural intuition.

---

## Empirical challenges


In practice:
- equity-implied spreads often underpredict observed spreads,
- short-term spreads are too small,
- liquidity and risk premia are missing.

These gaps motivate reduced-form models.

---

## Key takeaways


- Structural models unify equity and credit pricing.
- They provide strong economic intuition.
- Empirical fit is often imperfect.
