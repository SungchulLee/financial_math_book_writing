# Exploration vs Exploitation


A fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning is balancing **exploration** and **exploitation** when learning optimal decisions from data.

---

## The trade-off


- **Exploitation:** choosing actions believed to be optimal.
- **Exploration:** trying uncertain actions to gather information.

Too much exploitation risks missing better strategies; too much exploration reduces performance.

## Exploration strategies


Common approaches include:
- \(\epsilon\)-greedy policies,
- softmax (Boltzmann) exploration,
- upper confidence bound (UCB) methods.

Each balances risk and information gain differently.

---

## Financial implications


In financial settings:
- exploration corresponds to trying new strategies,
- exploitation corresponds to refining profitable trades,
- exploration is costly and risky in live markets.

This makes exploration especially challenging.

---

## Practical considerations


Finance often relies on:
- offline training and simulation,
- conservative exploration,
- strong risk constraints.

Pure online exploration is rarely acceptable.

---

## Key takeaways


- Exploration–exploitation is a core RL challenge.
- Financial costs make exploration risky.
- Careful design and simulation are essential.
