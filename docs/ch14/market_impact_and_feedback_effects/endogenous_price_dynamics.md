# Endogenous Price Dynamics

In modern financial markets, prices are not purely exogenous processes. **Endogenous price dynamics** arise when trading activity itself influences prices.

---

## 1. Exogenous vs endogenous views

Traditional models assume:
- prices driven by external information,
- agents as price takers.

In reality:
- large trades move prices,
- strategies interact through markets,
- feedback loops emerge.

---

## 2. Market impact as endogeneity

Trading generates:
- temporary impact through order-book pressure,
- permanent impact through information revelation.

As a result, price dynamics depend on market participants’ actions.

---

## 3. Implications for modeling

Endogenous dynamics imply:
- violations of martingale assumptions,
- strategy-dependent returns,
- path dependence of prices.

Models must incorporate impact and feedback.

## 4. Financial applications

Endogeneity matters for:
- optimal execution,
- high-frequency trading,
- systemic risk analysis.

Ignoring it leads to underestimated risk.

---

## 5. Key takeaways

- Prices are shaped by trading behavior.
- Market impact creates feedback loops.
- Endogeneity challenges classical assumptions.
