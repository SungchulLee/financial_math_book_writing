# Hybrid Model-Based / Data-Driven Approaches

**Hybrid approaches** combine traditional financial models with data-driven learning to leverage the strengths of both paradigms.

---

## 1. Motivation for hybrid models

Pure model-based approaches:
- offer interpretability and structure,
- may be too rigid.

Pure data-driven approaches:
- offer flexibility,
- may violate financial principles.

Hybrid models bridge this gap.

---

## 2. Forms of hybridization

Common strategies include:
- learning residuals on top of parametric models,
- using ML to calibrate or adapt model parameters,
- embedding financial models within neural architectures.

---

## 3. Benefits in practice

Hybrid approaches:
- improve data efficiency,
- preserve no-arbitrage structure,
- enhance stability and interpretability.

They are widely adopted in practice.

---

## 4. Applications

Examples include:
- volatility surface modeling,
- yield curve fitting,
- execution and impact modeling.

Hybrid models often outperform purely data-driven ones.

---

## 5. Key takeaways

- Hybrid models balance structure and flexibility.
- They respect financial constraints.
- They are well-suited for regulated environments.
