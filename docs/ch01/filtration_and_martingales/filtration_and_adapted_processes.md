# Filtration

## Filtered probability spaces

A **filtered probability space** is a quadruple



$$
(\Omega,\mathcal{F},(\mathcal{F}_t)_{t\ge 0},\mathbb{P}),
$$






where \((\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P})\) is a probability space and \((\mathcal{F}_t)_{t\ge 0}\) is an increasing family of sub-\(\sigma\)-algebras:



$$
\mathcal{F}_s \subseteq \mathcal{F}_t \subseteq \mathcal{F}\quad \text{for } 0\le s\le t.
$$






Interpretation: \(\mathcal{F}_t\) represents the information available up to time \(t\).

## Usual conditions

A filtration \((\mathcal{F}_t)\) satisfies the **usual conditions** if:

1. (**Right-continuity**) \(\mathcal{F}_t=\bigcap_{u>t}\mathcal{F}_u\) for all \(t\ge 0\).
2. (**Completeness**) \(\mathcal{F}_0\) contains all \(\mathbb{P}\)-null sets in \(\mathcal{F}\).

These conditions simplify stopping-time arguments and ensure good path properties for martingales.

## Measurability of processes

Let \(X=\{X_t\}_{t\ge 0}\) be a process with values in \(\mathbb{R}^d\).

### Adaptedness
\(X\) is **adapted** to \((\mathcal{F}_t)\) if, for each \(t\ge 0\),



$$
X_t \text{ is } \mathcal{F}_t\text{-measurable}.
$$






Interpretation: \(X_t\) is known at time \(t\).

### Progressively measurable
\(X\) is **progressively measurable** if, for each \(t\ge 0\), the map



$$
(s,\omega)\mapsto X_s(\omega)\mathbf{1}_{[0,t]}(s)
$$






is measurable with respect to \(\mathcal{B}([0,t])\otimes\mathcal{F}_t\).

This condition is natural for stochastic integration. In particular, adapted processes with suitable regularity (e.g. left-continuous with right limits) are progressively measurable.

### Predictable
A process is **predictable** if it is measurable with respect to the predictable \(\sigma\)-algebra (generated by left-continuous adapted processes). Predictability is the most common integrand class for Itô integration.

## Brownian motion and its natural filtration

A standard Brownian motion \(\{W_t\}\) generates a natural filtration



$$
\mathcal{F}_t^W := \sigma(W_s:0\le s\le t).
$$






One often uses its augmentation (completion + right-continuity):



$$
\mathcal{F}_t := \bigcap_{u>t}\left(\mathcal{F}_u^W \vee \mathcal{N}\right),
$$






where \(\mathcal{N}\) is the collection of \(\mathbb{P}\)-null sets.

With respect to this filtration, Brownian motion has the **independent increments** property in the conditional form:



$$
W_t-W_s \text{ is independent of } \mathcal{F}_s,\quad 0\le s<t.
$$

## Why filtrations matter

Stochastic calculus depends critically on information flow:

- In Itô integration \(\int_0^t H_s\,\mathrm{d}W_s\), the integrand \(H_s\) must be determined by information available at time \(s\) (typically predictable).
- **Martingales** formalize "fair game" behavior relative to \((\mathcal{F}_t)\). We explore the rich martingale structure of Brownian motion in the next section.
- **Stopping times** formalize random times that can be decided using current information.

The framework established here—filtered probability spaces, adapted processes, and information flow—forms the foundation for understanding martingales, stopping times, and ultimately stochastic integration.
