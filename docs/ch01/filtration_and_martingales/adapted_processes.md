# Adapted Processes

## Overview

In the study of stochastic processes, **adaptedness** and related measurability concepts formalize the intuition that a process should not "see into the future." These concepts are essential for defining meaningful operations like stochastic integration and for ensuring that trading strategies and other decision processes use only available information.

**Prerequisite**: This document assumes familiarity with filtered probability spaces $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, (\mathcal{F}_t)_{t \ge 0}, \mathbb{P})$ as developed in the companion document *Filtration*. We assume the filtration satisfies the usual conditions (right-continuous and complete) unless otherwise stated.

## Measurability Concepts for Stochastic Processes

Let $X = (X_t)_{t \ge 0}$ be a stochastic process with values in $\mathbb{R}^d$ defined on a filtered probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, (\mathcal{F}_t), \mathbb{P})$. Several measurability notions capture different aspects of the relationship between $X$ and the filtration, forming a hierarchy from weakest to strongest regularity.

### 1. Adaptedness

$X$ is **adapted** to $(\mathcal{F}_t)$ if, for each $t \ge 0$,

$$
X_t \text{ is } \mathcal{F}_t\text{-measurable}.
$$

**Interpretation**: The value $X_t$ is determined by information available at time $t$. One cannot "see into the future."

**Example**: If $(W_t)$ is Brownian motion and $\mathcal{F}_t = \sigma(W_s : 0 \le s \le t)$, then $W_t$ is adapted by construction. However, $W_{t+1}$ is **not** $\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable.

**Non-example**: The process $X_t = W_1$ (constant in $t$, equal to the value of Brownian motion at time 1) is **not** adapted to $(\mathcal{F}_t^W)$ for $t < 1$, because $W_1$ is not $\mathcal{F}_t^W$-measurable when $t < 1$.

### 2. Progressive Measurability

$X$ is **progressively measurable** if, for each $t \ge 0$, the map

$$
(s, \omega) \mapsto X_s(\omega)
$$

restricted to $[0, t] \times \Omega$ is measurable with respect to $\mathcal{B}([0, t]) \otimes \mathcal{F}_t$.

**Interpretation**: Progressive measurability is joint measurability in time and outcome, with the constraint that at time $t$, we only use information available up to $t$. This is stronger than adaptedness because it requires the process to be "well-behaved" as a function of both variables simultaneously.

**Why it matters**: Progressive measurability ensures that stopped processes $X_\tau$ are well-defined and measurable for stopping times $\tau$. It is the natural measurability class for integrands in stochastic integration.

**Key fact**: Every adapted process with **càdlàg** (right-continuous with left limits) or **càglàd** (left-continuous with right limits) paths is progressively measurable. This follows because such processes can be approximated by simple processes, and the approximation preserves measurability. See Karatzas & Shreve, *Brownian Motion and Stochastic Calculus*, Proposition 1.1.13.

**Example**: Brownian motion $(W_t)$ has continuous paths, hence is progressively measurable with respect to its natural filtration.

**Non-example (adapted but not progressively measurable)**: Constructing such examples requires care. Here is a standard one: Assume the Continuum Hypothesis and let $\Omega = [0,1]$ with $\mathcal{F}_t = \mathcal{B}([0,1])$ for all $t$. There exists a set $D \subseteq [0,1] \times [0,1]$ such that every vertical section $D_\omega = \{t : (t,\omega) \in D\}$ is countable (hence Lebesgue-null and Borel), but $D \notin \mathcal{B}([0,1]) \otimes \mathcal{B}([0,1])$. Define $X_t(\omega) = \mathbf{1}_D(t, \omega)$. For each fixed $t$, the horizontal section is Borel, so $X_t$ is $\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable (adapted). But $(t,\omega) \mapsto X_t(\omega)$ is not jointly measurable.

For a more elementary (if less explicit) approach: the existence of adapted processes that are not progressively measurable follows from cardinality arguments. In practice, all "naturally occurring" adapted processes (those with càdlàg or càglàd paths, or even just measurable paths) are progressively measurable.

### 3. Optional Processes

A process $X$ is **optional** if it is measurable with respect to the **optional σ-algebra** $\mathcal{O}$ on $\Omega \times [0, \infty)$.

**Formal definition**: The optional σ-algebra $\mathcal{O}$ is defined as the σ-algebra on $\Omega \times [0, \infty)$ generated by all càdlàg adapted processes. Equivalently, $\mathcal{O}$ is generated by the stochastic intervals:

$$
[\![S, T]\!] := \{(\omega, t) : S(\omega) \le t \le T(\omega)\}
$$

for all stopping times $S \le T$. In particular, $\mathcal{O}$ contains $[\![0, T]\!] = \{(\omega, t) : 0 \le t \le T(\omega)\}$ for every stopping time $T$.

**Interpretation**: Optional processes are those that can be "observed" at stopping times. The optional σ-algebra captures events that are determined by stopping at random times.

**Example**: Any càdlàg adapted process is optional (by definition of $\mathcal{O}$).

**Example (optional but not predictable)**: Let $(N_t)$ be a Poisson process and let $\tau_1$ be its first jump time. Define $X_t = \mathbf{1}_{\{t \ge \tau_1\}}$. This process:
- Is càdlàg (right-continuous with a single jump)
- Is adapted (at time $t$, we know whether the jump has occurred)
- Is optional (càdlàg adapted)
- Is **not** predictable — we cannot know "just before $\tau_1$" that the jump is about to occur, because $\tau_1$ is a *totally inaccessible* stopping time

### 4. Predictability

A process $X$ is **predictable** if it is measurable with respect to the **predictable σ-algebra** $\mathcal{P}$ on $\Omega \times [0, \infty)$.

**Formal definition**: The predictable σ-algebra $\mathcal{P}$ is defined as the σ-algebra generated by all càglàd (left-continuous) adapted processes. Equivalently, $\mathcal{P}$ is generated by sets of the form:

$$
\{0\} \times F_0 \quad \text{and} \quad (s, t] \times F_s, \quad F_0 \in \mathcal{F}_0, \, F_s \in \mathcal{F}_s, \, 0 \le s < t.
$$

**Why these generators?** The sets $(s, t] \times F_s$ represent "during the interval $(s,t]$, the event $F_s$ holds." Crucially, $F_s \in \mathcal{F}_s$ means the event is determined by information available at time $s$, strictly before the interval $(s,t]$ begins. This captures the "no peeking" property.

**Interpretation**: A predictable process at time $t$ is determined by information strictly before $t$. This is the strongest measurability condition in our hierarchy.

**Example**: Any càglàd (left-continuous) adapted process is predictable. In particular, any continuous adapted process is predictable.

**Example**: In discrete time, a process $(H_n)_{n \ge 1}$ is predictable if and only if $H_n$ is $\mathcal{F}_{n-1}$-measurable for all $n \ge 1$. The value at time $n$ is determined by information at time $n-1$.

## Hierarchy of Measurability

The four measurability classes form a strict hierarchy:

$$
\text{Predictable} \subsetneq \text{Optional} \subsetneq \text{Progressively measurable} \subsetneq \text{Adapted}
$$

**Reading the hierarchy**: Smaller classes impose stricter conditions. A predictable process satisfies the most stringent requirements; an adapted process satisfies the weakest.

```
Hierarchy (smaller = more regular):

    Predictable  ⊂  Optional  ⊂  Prog. meas.  ⊂  Adapted
         ↑              ↑              ↑              ↑
    Left-cont.     Right-cont.    Joint meas.    Pointwise
     adapted        adapted       in (t,ω)        meas.
```

**Intuition for inclusions**:

- **Predictable ⊂ Optional**: The generators of $\mathcal{P}$, namely $(s,t] \times F_s$ with $F_s \in \mathcal{F}_s$, can be represented as $\{(\omega, u) : s < u \le t, \omega \in F_s\}$. This set is the "graph" of holding the event $F_s$ constant over the interval $(s,t]$, which can be expressed using càdlàg adapted indicator processes, hence lies in $\mathcal{O}$.
- **Optional ⊂ Progressively measurable**: If $X$ is optional, then for each $t$, the restriction to $[0,t] \times \Omega$ is measurable w.r.t. $\mathcal{B}([0,t]) \otimes \mathcal{F}_t$ (this requires proof, but follows from the structure of $\mathcal{O}$).
- **Progressively measurable ⊂ Adapted**: If $(s,\omega) \mapsto X_s(\omega)$ is jointly measurable on $[0,t] \times \Omega$ w.r.t. $\mathcal{B}([0,t]) \otimes \mathcal{F}_t$, then evaluating at $s = t$ shows $X_t$ is $\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable.

**When do the classes coincide?** For processes with **continuous paths**:

$$
\text{Continuous adapted} = \text{Predictable} = \text{Optional} = \text{Prog. meas.}
$$

Hence for continuous processes, all four classes coincide. The distinctions become essential for **jump processes** (Poisson processes, Lévy processes, solutions to SDEs with jumps).

## Properties of Adapted Processes

### Algebraic Closure

Adapted processes are closed under standard operations:

- If $X_t$ and $Y_t$ are adapted, then $X_t + Y_t$, $X_t \cdot Y_t$, and $f(X_t)$ (for Borel measurable $f$) are adapted.
- Pointwise limits of adapted processes are adapted: if $X_t^n \to X_t$ for each $t$ and $\omega$, and each $X^n$ is adapted, then $X$ is adapted. (This follows because pointwise limits of measurable functions are measurable.)

### Integral Processes

If $X_t$ is adapted, measurable in $t$, and satisfies $\int_0^t |X_s| \, ds < \infty$ a.s., then the integral process

$$
Y_t = \int_0^t X_s \, ds
$$

is also adapted. This follows because $Y_t$ depends only on $(X_s)_{0 \le s \le t}$.

**Stronger result**: If $X$ is progressively measurable, then $Y_t = \int_0^t X_s \, ds$ is also progressively measurable.

## Connection to Filtrations

The concept of adaptedness is inherently tied to the choice of filtration:

- A process may be adapted to one filtration but not another.
- The **natural filtration** $\mathcal{F}_t^X = \sigma(X_s : 0 \le s \le t)$ is the smallest filtration to which $X$ is adapted.
- Working with a larger filtration (e.g., one that includes additional market information) may change which processes are adapted.

**Example**: Let $(W_t)$ and $(B_t)$ be independent Brownian motions. The process $W_t$ is adapted to $\mathcal{F}_t^W$ but also to the larger filtration $\mathcal{G}_t = \sigma(W_s, B_s : s \le t)$. However, $B_t$ is adapted to $\mathcal{G}_t$ but not to $\mathcal{F}_t^W$.

---

## Applications

### Mathematical Finance

In no-arbitrage theory, a trading strategy $(H_t)$ representing portfolio holdings must be **predictable**:

- The number of shares held at time $t$ must be decided based on information available strictly before $t$.
- This prevents "anticipating" price jumps or using future information.
- If $H$ were merely adapted (not predictable), a trader could potentially adjust holdings at the exact moment of a price jump, which is unrealistic and leads to arbitrage.

### Stochastic Integration

The Itô integral $\int_0^t H_s \, dW_s$ requires:

- $H$ to be at least progressively measurable (for the integral to be well-defined via approximation by simple processes).
- $H$ to be predictable (for optimal theoretical properties, including the Itô isometry and martingale property of the integral).

For Brownian motion (continuous paths), progressive measurability and predictability coincide for adapted processes, so the distinction is often glossed over. For integration with respect to jump processes (e.g., Poisson or Lévy), predictability becomes essential.

### Stopping and Localization

Progressive measurability ensures that:

- Stopped processes $X_{t \wedge \tau}$ are measurable for stopping times $\tau$.
- Localization arguments (using stopping times to control integrability) work correctly.

**Optional and predictable projections**: For any bounded measurable process $Y$:
- There exists a unique optional process ${}^o Y$ (the *optional projection*) such that ${}^o Y_\tau = \mathbb{E}[Y_\tau \mid \mathcal{F}_\tau]$ for all stopping times $\tau$.
- There exists a unique predictable process ${}^p Y$ (the *predictable projection*) such that ${}^p Y_\tau = \mathbb{E}[Y_\tau \mid \mathcal{F}_{\tau-}]$ for all predictable stopping times $\tau$.

## Summary

| Concept | Definition | Interpretation | Key Example |
|---------|------------|----------------|-------------|
| Adapted | $X_t$ is $\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable for each $t$ | Value at $t$ uses only info up to $t$ | Brownian motion |
| Prog. meas. | Joint measurability on $[0,t] \times \Omega$ | Needed for stopping and integration | Càdlàg adapted |
| Optional | Measurable w.r.t. $\mathcal{O}$ | Observable at stopping times | $\mathbf{1}_{\{t \ge \tau\}}$ |
| Predictable | Measurable w.r.t. $\mathcal{P}$ | Determined by strictly past info | Continuous adapted |

**Hierarchy** (strict inclusions, smaller = more regular):

$$
\text{Predictable} \subsetneq \text{Optional} \subsetneq \text{Prog. meas.} \subsetneq \text{Adapted}
$$

For continuous processes, all classes coincide. For jump processes, the distinctions are crucial.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Adapted Processes — Basic Properties

(a) Prove that if $X_t$ and $Y_t$ are adapted to $(\mathcal{F}_t)$, then so are $X_t + Y_t$ and $X_t \cdot Y_t$.

(b) Let $(W_t)$ be Brownian motion with natural filtration $(\mathcal{F}_t^W)$. Show that $W_{t+1}$ is **not** adapted to $(\mathcal{F}_t^W)$.

(c) Let $X_t = \int_0^t W_s \, ds$. Prove that $X_t$ is adapted to $(\mathcal{F}_t^W)$.

*Hint*: Use the fact that $\mathbb{E}[\int_0^t |W_s| \, ds] < \infty$ and that $X_t$ depends only on $(W_s)_{s \le t}$.

### Exercise 2: Progressive Measurability

(a) Let $X$ be an adapted process with left-continuous paths. Prove that $X$ is progressively measurable.

*Hint*: For fixed $t$, define $X^n_s(\omega) = X_{(k-1)/2^n}(\omega)$ for $s \in ((k-1)/2^n, k/2^n] \cap [0,t]$. Show each $X^n$ is $\mathcal{B}([0,t]) \otimes \mathcal{F}_t$-measurable (it's a step function in $s$ with $\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable values), and $X^n \to X$ pointwise by left-continuity.

(b) Give an example of an adapted process that is not progressively measurable.

*Hint*: See the diagonal indicator example in the main text. Verify that it is adapted but not jointly measurable.

(c) Let $X$ be progressively measurable and let $\tau$ be a stopping time. Show that for each $t \ge 0$, the random variable $X_\tau \mathbf{1}_{\{\tau \le t\}}$ is $\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable.

*Hint*: On the event $\{\tau \le t\}$, the map $\omega \mapsto (\tau(\omega), \omega)$ takes values in $[0,t] \times \Omega$. Use the composition $X_\tau(\omega) = X(\tau(\omega), \omega)$ and the joint measurability of $X$ on $[0,t] \times \Omega$.

### Exercise 3: The Hierarchy of Measurability

(a) Show that $\mathcal{P} \subseteq \mathcal{O}$ by verifying that the generators of $\mathcal{P}$ lie in $\mathcal{O}$.

*Hint*: Show that $(s,t] \times F_s$ with $F_s \in \mathcal{F}_s$ can be written using càdlàg adapted indicator processes.

(b) Let $(N_t)$ be a Poisson process with intensity $\lambda > 0$, and let $\tau_1 = \inf\{t : N_t \ge 1\}$ be the first jump time. Define $X_t = \mathbf{1}_{\{t \ge \tau_1\}}$.

- Verify that $X$ is adapted to the natural filtration of $N$.
- Verify that $X$ is càdlàg, hence optional.
- Argue that $X$ is **not** predictable.

*Hint for non-predictability*: $\tau_1$ is a totally inaccessible stopping time (it cannot be announced by an increasing sequence of stopping times). For a predictable process, the "jump" would need to be predictable.

(c) Prove: If $X$ is a continuous adapted process, then $X$ is predictable.

*Hint*: A continuous function is in particular left-continuous (càglàd). By definition, the predictable σ-algebra $\mathcal{P}$ is generated by all càglàd adapted processes. Therefore, any càglàd adapted process is $\mathcal{P}$-measurable, i.e., predictable. Since continuous implies càglàd, we're done.

### Exercise 4: Predictability in Finance

(a) In discrete time with filtration $(\mathcal{F}_n)_{n \ge 0}$, prove that a process $(H_n)_{n \ge 1}$ is predictable if and only if $H_n$ is $\mathcal{F}_{n-1}$-measurable for all $n \ge 1$.

*Hint*: The predictable σ-algebra in discrete time is generated by sets of the form $\{n\} \times F_{n-1}$ for $F_{n-1} \in \mathcal{F}_{n-1}$.

(b) Explain why trading strategies must be predictable rather than merely adapted. Construct a concrete "arbitrage" example using an adapted but non-predictable strategy.

*Hint*: Consider a stock priced at $S_t$ that jumps from $\$100$ to $\$150$ at a totally inaccessible stopping time $\tau$. An adapted (but non-predictable) strategy could be: "hold 1 share during the instant of the jump," i.e., $H_t = \mathbf{1}_{\{t = \tau\}}$. This is adapted (at each time $t$, we know if $t = \tau$) but not predictable (we can't know just before $\tau$ that we should buy). The "profit" is $H_\tau \cdot \Delta S_\tau = 1 \cdot 50 = \$50$, achieved with zero investment before the jump. This is arbitrage. In reality, one cannot implement such a strategy because buying takes time—you must decide to hold *before* observing the jump, which is exactly what predictability enforces.

(c) In the Black-Scholes model (continuous prices), explain why the distinction between adapted and predictable is less critical.

### Exercise 5: Connecting to the Filtration Document

Using the random walk setting from the companion document *Filtration*:

Let $(X_n)_{n \ge 1}$ be i.i.d. coin flips with $X_n \in \{+1, -1\}$, $S_n = X_1 + \cdots + X_n$, $S_0 = 0$, and $\mathcal{F}_n = \sigma(X_1, \ldots, X_n)$ with $\mathcal{F}_0 = \{\emptyset, \Omega\}$.

(a) Show that $(S_n)_{n \ge 0}$ is adapted to $(\mathcal{F}_n)$.

(b) Define $H_n = S_{n-1}$ for $n \ge 1$ (with $H_0 = 0$). Is $(H_n)$ predictable? Justify your answer.

(c) Is the process $Y_n = X_n = S_n - S_{n-1}$ (for $n \ge 1$) predictable? Justify.

(d) Define $\tau = \min\{n \ge 1 : S_n = 2\}$ (first hitting time of level 2). Classify the process $Z_n = \mathbf{1}_{\{n \ge \tau\}}$:
- Is it adapted?
- Is it predictable?
- Justify each answer.
