# Empirical Stylized Facts


Empirical studies of implied volatility dynamics reveal robust **stylized facts** that any realistic model should aim to reproduce.

---

## Skew dynamics


Observed skew behavior:
- skew steepens after negative spot moves,
- skew relaxes slowly over time,
- skew dynamics are asymmetric.

This is often referred to as the leverage effect in implied space.

---

## Term-structure behavior


Empirically:
- short-term smiles react strongly to spot moves,
- long-term smiles are more stable,
- volatility shocks propagate gradually across maturities.

---

## Persistence and mean reversion


Implied volatility exhibits:
- strong persistence,
- slow mean reversion,
- clustering similar to realized volatility.

---

## Cross-asset differences


Stylized facts vary across markets:
- FX smiles are closer to sticky delta,
- equity index smiles show strong downside skew,
- single stocks show idiosyncratic behavior.

---

## Key takeaways


- Smile dynamics follow robust empirical patterns.
- These patterns challenge simple models.
- Stylized facts guide model development and validation.
