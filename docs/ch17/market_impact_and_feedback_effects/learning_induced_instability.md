# Learning-Induced Instability


When many agents adapt their strategies using similar learning rules, **learning-induced instability** can arise, amplifying volatility and systemic risk.

---

## Adaptive strategies


Learning algorithms:
- update based on past performance,
- respond to observed market patterns,
- often share similar objectives.

Collective adaptation can destabilize markets.

---

## Feedback amplification


Learning-induced effects include:
- crowded trades,
- self-reinforcing trends,
- sudden regime shifts.

Small signals can be amplified through learning feedback.

---

## Examples


Examples include:
- volatility targeting strategies,
- trend-following algorithms,
- risk-parity portfolio adjustments.

These strategies can synchronize behavior.

---

## Risk management implications


Learning-induced instability implies:
- non-linear risk amplification,
- failure of diversification,
- need for macroprudential oversight.

Models assuming independent agents are insufficient.

## Key takeaways


- Adaptive learning can destabilize markets.
- Feedback loops amplify shocks.
- Stability requires diversity and constraints.
