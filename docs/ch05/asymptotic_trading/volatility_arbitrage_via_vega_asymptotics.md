# Volatility Arbitrage via Vega Asymptotics

Vega scales like \(\sqrt{\tau}\) near the money, so mid-maturity options often carry larger vega per contract than very short maturities.

## What to remember

- Choose maturities where vega is concentrated for efficient vol bets.
- Use short maturities primarily for gamma/realized-variance exposure.
