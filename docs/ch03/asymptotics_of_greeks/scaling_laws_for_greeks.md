# Scaling Laws for Greeks

Near-the-money Black–Scholes scalings (heuristic):


\[
\Gamma \sim \frac{1}{S\sigma\sqrt{\tau}},
\qquad
\nu \sim S\sqrt{\tau},
\]


and theta magnitude near the money is often of order \(\tau^{-1/2}\).

Far from the money, Greeks may be exponentially small in \(1/\tau\) for short times.

## What to remember

- Short-dated options: large gamma, unstable higher Greeks.
- Mid maturities: larger vega exposure.
- Extreme strikes: tail-dominated sensitivities.
