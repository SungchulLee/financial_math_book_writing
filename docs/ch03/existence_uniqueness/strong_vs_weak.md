# Strong and Weak Solutions of SDEs

The theory of stochastic differential equations distinguishes between two fundamentally different notions of solution: **strong solutions** and **weak solutions**. Understanding this distinction is essential for rigorous work with SDEs and has important implications for uniqueness, existence, and applications.

## The Two Notions of Solution

Consider the SDE:

$$
dX_t = b(t, X_t)\,dt + \sigma(t, X_t)\,dW_t, \quad X_0 = x
$$

**The key question**: What is "given" and what must be "constructed"?

### Strong Solution

**Given**: 
- A probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})$
- A Brownian motion $W_t$ on this space
- An initial condition $x$

**Construct**: A process $X_t$ adapted to the filtration generated by $W_t$ that satisfies the SDE.

**Intuition**: The solution $X_t$ is a **functional of the given Brownian motion**:

$$
X_t = F(W_s : 0 \leq s \leq t)
$$

### Weak Solution

**Given**: 
- Coefficients $b$ and $\sigma$
- An initial distribution $\mu$ (or initial point $x$)

**Construct**: A probability space, a Brownian motion $W_t$, AND a process $X_t$ that together satisfy the SDE.

**Intuition**: We only need $(X_t, W_t)$ to have the correct **joint distribution**. The Brownian motion is part of the solution, not given in advance.

## Formal Definitions

### Definition (Strong Solution)

Let $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, (\mathcal{F}_t), \mathbb{P})$ be a filtered probability space carrying a Brownian motion $W_t$. A **strong solution** is a continuous adapted process $X_t$ such that:

1. $X_t$ is adapted to $\mathcal{F}_t^W = \sigma(W_s : 0 \leq s \leq t)$ (the natural filtration of $W$)

2. $\int_0^T (|b(t, X_t)| + \sigma^2(t, X_t))\,dt < \infty$ a.s.

3. $X_t = x + \int_0^t b(s, X_s)\,ds + \int_0^t \sigma(s, X_s)\,dW_s$ a.s.

### Definition (Weak Solution)

A **weak solution** is a tuple $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, (\mathcal{F}_t), \mathbb{P}, W_t, X_t)$ where:

1. $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, (\mathcal{F}_t), \mathbb{P})$ is a filtered probability space satisfying the usual conditions

2. $W_t$ is a Brownian motion with respect to $(\mathcal{F}_t)$

3. $X_t$ is continuous and adapted to $(\mathcal{F}_t)$

4. The SDE is satisfied: $X_t = x + \int_0^t b(s, X_s)\,ds + \int_0^t \sigma(s, X_s)\,dW_s$

**Note**: For weak solutions, $X_t$ need not be adapted to the filtration generated by $W_t$ alone—it can depend on additional randomness.

## Uniqueness Concepts

### Pathwise Uniqueness (Strong Uniqueness)

**Definition**: **Pathwise uniqueness** holds if whenever $(X_t, W_t)$ and $(Y_t, W_t)$ are two solutions on the **same** probability space with the **same** Brownian motion and $X_0 = Y_0$ a.s., then:

$$
\mathbb{P}(X_t = Y_t \text{ for all } t \geq 0) = 1
$$

**Meaning**: The solution is uniquely determined by the Brownian path.

### Uniqueness in Law (Weak Uniqueness)

**Definition**: **Uniqueness in law** holds if any two weak solutions $(X_t, W_t)$ and $(X_t', W_t')$ with the same initial distribution have the same law:

$$
\text{Law}(X_t) = \text{Law}(X_t') \quad \text{for all } t
$$

**Meaning**: The probability distribution of the solution is unique, though individual paths may differ.

### Relationship

$$
\text{Pathwise uniqueness} \Longrightarrow \text{Uniqueness in law}
$$

The converse is **false** in general.

## The Yamada-Watanabe Theorem

This fundamental theorem connects the different solution concepts.

**Theorem (Yamada-Watanabe, 1971)**:

$$
\boxed{
\text{Pathwise uniqueness} + \text{Weak existence} \Longrightarrow \text{Strong existence}
}
$$

More precisely:

1. If pathwise uniqueness holds and a weak solution exists, then a strong solution exists.

2. If pathwise uniqueness holds and a weak solution exists, then uniqueness in law also holds.

**Significance**: To prove strong existence, it suffices to:
- Prove pathwise uniqueness (often easier)
- Construct any weak solution (flexibility in construction)

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Lipschitz Coefficients (Strong Solution)

For the SDE $dX_t = b(X_t)\,dt + \sigma(X_t)\,dW_t$ with Lipschitz coefficients:

- **Strong existence**: Yes (Picard iteration)
- **Pathwise uniqueness**: Yes (Gronwall inequality)
- **Uniqueness in law**: Yes (follows from pathwise uniqueness)

### Example 2: Tanaka's SDE (Weak but Not Strong)

Consider:

$$
dX_t = \text{sgn}(X_t)\,dW_t, \quad X_0 = 0
$$

where $\text{sgn}(x) = 1$ if $x > 0$, $-1$ if $x < 0$, and $0$ if $x = 0$.

**Facts**:

1. **Weak solution exists**: $X_t = |B_t|$ where $B_t$ is Brownian motion (reflected Brownian motion)

2. **Pathwise uniqueness fails**: Both $X_t = |B_t|$ and $X_t = -|B_t|$ solve the SDE with the same $W_t$

3. **Strong solution does not exist**: $X_t$ cannot be written as a functional of $W_t$

4. **Uniqueness in law holds**: $\text{Law}(X_t) = \text{Law}(|B_t|)$ is unique

### Example 3: Tsirelson's Example (No Weak Solution)

There exist SDEs with no weak solution at all. These involve pathological coefficients that create contradictions in the probability structure.

## When Does Strong Existence Hold?

### Sufficient Conditions

1. **Lipschitz + Linear growth** → Strong existence and pathwise uniqueness

2. **Yamada-Watanabe conditions** (for 1D):
   - Lipschitz drift
   - $|\sigma(x) - \sigma(y)| \leq \rho(|x-y|)$ with $\int_0^{\epsilon} \rho^{-2}(u)\,du = \infty$

3. **Monotonicity conditions** (for multidimensional SDEs)

### Checking Strong Existence

**Practical approach**:

1. Verify pathwise uniqueness (Gronwall, Yamada-Watanabe)
2. Construct any weak solution (martingale problem, Girsanov)
3. Apply Yamada-Watanabe theorem

---

## The Martingale Problem Approach

Weak solutions are naturally connected to the **Stroock-Varadhan martingale problem**.

**Theorem**: $(X_t, W_t)$ is a weak solution to the SDE if and only if $X_t$ solves the martingale problem for the generator:

$$
\mathcal{L} = b^i(x)\partial_i + \frac{1}{2}a^{ij}(x)\partial_i\partial_j, \quad a = \sigma\sigma^T
$$

**Advantage**: The martingale problem characterizes the **law** of $X_t$, which is exactly what weak solutions specify.

## Girsanov's Theorem and Weak Solutions

Girsanov's theorem provides a powerful method for constructing weak solutions.

**Idea**: Start with a simple SDE (e.g., $dX_t = \sigma(X_t)\,dW_t$), then change measure to introduce drift.

**Theorem**: If $X_t$ solves $dX_t = \sigma(X_t)\,d\widetilde{W}_t$ under $\widetilde{\mathbb{P}}$, then under the measure $\mathbb{P}$ defined by:

$$
\frac{d\mathbb{P}}{d\widetilde{\mathbb{P}}} = \exp\left(-\int_0^T \theta_s\,d\widetilde{W}_s - \frac{1}{2}\int_0^T \theta_s^2\,ds\right)
$$

with $\theta_t = \sigma^{-1}(X_t)b(X_t)$, the process $X_t$ solves:

$$
dX_t = b(X_t)\,dt + \sigma(X_t)\,dW_t
$$

where $W_t = \widetilde{W}_t + \int_0^t \theta_s\,ds$ is a Brownian motion under $\mathbb{P}$.

## Summary Table

| Concept | Definition | Uniqueness Type |
|---------|------------|-----------------|
| **Strong solution** | $X_t$ adapted to $\mathcal{F}_t^W$ | Pathwise uniqueness |
| **Weak solution** | $(X_t, W_t)$ jointly constructed | Uniqueness in law |
| **Pathwise uniqueness** | Same $W_t \Rightarrow$ same $X_t$ | Strongest |
| **Uniqueness in law** | Same distribution | Weakest |

---

## Practical Implications

### For Simulation

- **Strong solutions**: Simulate $W_t$, compute $X_t$ pathwise
- **Weak solutions**: Only the distribution of $X_t$ is meaningful; different simulations may use different probability spaces

### For Finance

- **Pricing**: Only needs weak solutions (distribution matters)
- **Hedging**: May need strong solutions (pathwise relationship to underlying)

### For Filtering

- Strong solutions essential: the filter must compute $X_t$ from observed signals
