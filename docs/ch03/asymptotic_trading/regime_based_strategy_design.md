# Regime-Based Strategy Design

Greeks quantify exposures; regimes determine whether those exposures are rewarded (realized variance, jump risk, liquidity).

## What to remember

- Strategy selection should match the dominant risk channel: gamma (short), vega (mid), tails (extremes).
- Robustness across regimes is a primary design objective.
