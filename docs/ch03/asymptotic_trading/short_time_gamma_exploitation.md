# Short-Time Gamma Exploitation

Short-dated options have extreme gamma near the money:
\[
\Gamma \sim \frac{1}{S\sigma\sqrt{\tau}}.
\]
This creates both opportunity (realized variance capture) and risk (hedge turnover and costs).

## What to remember

- Short time amplifies gamma-driven P&L and hedging instability.
- Any realistic analysis must include discrete hedging and transaction costs.
