# Robustness vs Optimality

Optimal strategies are model-dependent; robust strategies trade some optimality for stability under uncertainty.

## What to remember

- Robust design uses stress tests across models (local vol, stochastic vol, jumps).
- Stability of P&L drivers across regimes is often more important than pointwise optimality.
