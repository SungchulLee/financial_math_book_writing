# Static vs Dynamic Hedging

Dynamic hedging rebalances continuously (ideal) or frequently (practical). Static hedging uses portfolios of traded options to reduce rebalancing needs.

## Static hedging idea

Approximate \(H\) by a portfolio of vanilla payoffs:

\[
H \approx \sum_i a_i H_i.
\]

## What to remember

- Dynamic hedging is fragile under costs/jumps.
- Static hedging transfers risk using other traded derivatives.
- Practical hedging is often hybrid.
