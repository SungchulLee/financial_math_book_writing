# Delta-Neutral Strategies

Delta-neutral portfolios eliminate first-order exposure to underlying price changes.

---

## Condition

For portfolio \(\Pi(t,S)\),
\[
\boxed{\frac{\partial \Pi}{\partial S}(t,S)=0.}
\]

---

## Local nature

Delta neutrality holds only locally; rebalancing is required as \(S\) moves and delta changes.

---

## What to remember

- Delta-neutral isolates gamma/vega/theta risks.
- It is a decomposition tool rather than a complete hedge.
