# Theta Decay and Carry Trades

Option selling often earns theta but takes tail and volatility risk.

## Theta identity

From Black–Scholes,
\[
\boxed{
\Theta
=
-\frac{1}{2}\sigma^2 S^2 \Gamma - rS\Delta + rV.
}
\]

## What to remember

- Earning theta typically means short gamma and short vega.
- “Carry” depends on realized volatility and jump risk.
