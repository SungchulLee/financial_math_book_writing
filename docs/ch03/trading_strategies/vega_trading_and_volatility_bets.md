# Vega Trading and Volatility Bets

Vega trades aim to profit from changes in implied volatility or mispricing between implied and realized volatility.

## Vega exposure

\[
\boxed{\nu_\Pi=\frac{\partial \Pi}{\partial \sigma}.}
\]

## Surface risk

In practice \(\sigma\) is not scalar; one trades exposures to the implied volatility surface \(\Sigma(T,K)\) (bucket vegas, skew, curvature).

## What to remember

- Vega trades interact with gamma and theta.
- Real markets require managing surface deformations, not a single volatility parameter.
