# Reverse Stress Testing

Reverse stress testing starts from **undesirable outcomes** and works backward to identify scenarios that would cause them. It is a powerful complement to traditional stress testing.

## 1. Concept

Instead of asking:
> “What happens under this scenario?”

Reverse stress testing asks:
> “What scenarios would break the institution?”

This shifts focus to vulnerabilities rather than probabilities.

---

## 2. Methodology

Typical steps:
1. Define a failure threshold (e.g., capital breach).
2. Identify portfolio losses required to reach it.
3. Construct scenarios that generate those losses.

Probability is secondary to plausibility.

## 3. Benefits

Reverse stress testing:
- exposes hidden assumptions,
- identifies risk concentrations,
- challenges business-as-usual thinking.

It is emphasized in regulatory frameworks.

---

## 4. Challenges

- Scenario construction is subjective.
- Results can be uncomfortable.
- Requires strong governance and transparency.

Despite this, it provides deep insight.

---

## 5. Key takeaways

- Reverse stress testing focuses on failure modes.
- It complements forward stress tests.
- It strengthens risk awareness and resilience.
