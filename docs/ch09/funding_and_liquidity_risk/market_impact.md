# Market Impact

**Market impact** refers to the price movement caused by executing trades. It is a key component of liquidity risk and trading cost.

## 1. Types of market impact

Market impact is often decomposed into:
- **temporary impact:** short-lived price pressure,
- **permanent impact:** lasting price changes due to information.

Both affect realized execution prices.

## 2. Determinants of impact

Market impact depends on:
- trade size relative to market depth,
- execution speed,
- prevailing market volatility and liquidity.

Impact is nonlinear in trade size.

## 3. Modeling market impact

Common models include:
- linear impact models,
- square-root impact laws,
- optimal execution frameworks (Almgren–Chriss).

These models guide execution strategies.

## 4. Risk management implications

Ignoring market impact:
- understates liquidation losses,
- invalidates hedging assumptions,
- leads to overly aggressive trading strategies.

Market impact is critical in stress scenarios.

## 5. Key takeaways

- Trading itself moves prices.
- Market impact is nonlinear and state-dependent.
