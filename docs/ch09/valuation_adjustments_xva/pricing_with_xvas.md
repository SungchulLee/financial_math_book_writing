# Pricing with XVAs

Modern derivative pricing integrates **XVAs** directly into valuation, moving beyond the classical risk-neutral pricing paradigm.

## 1. XVA-inclusive pricing equation

Pricing with XVAs leads to nonlinear valuation equations:
\[
V = V_{\text{risk-free}} - \text{CVA} + \text{DVA} - \text{FVA} - \text{KVA}.
\]

This breaks linearity and additivity of prices.

## 2. BSDE and PDE formulations

XVA pricing can be formulated using:
- backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs),
- nonlinear PDEs with close-out conditions.

These frameworks unify pricing, funding, and credit risk.

## 3. Impact on hedging

With XVAs:
- hedging strategies are institution-specific,
- perfect replication is impossible,
- pricing depends on balance-sheet considerations.

---

## 4. Organizational implications

XVA pricing affects:
- deal pricing and profitability,
- transfer pricing desks,
- risk and capital management.

It blurs the line between pricing and risk management.

## 5. Key takeaways

- XVAs fundamentally alter derivative pricing.
- Valuation becomes nonlinear and institution-specific.
- Pricing and risk management are tightly coupled.
