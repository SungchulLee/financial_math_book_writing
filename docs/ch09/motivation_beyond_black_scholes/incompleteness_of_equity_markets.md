# Incompleteness of Equity Markets


The Black–Scholes model assumes a **complete market**, where all risks can be perfectly hedged. Empirically and structurally, equity markets are incomplete, which fundamentally limits the model’s applicability.

## Market completeness in Black–Scholes


In the Black–Scholes world:
- a single traded asset and a risk-free bond suffice,
- continuous trading eliminates all risk,
- derivative payoffs can be replicated exactly.

This relies on continuous paths and constant volatility.

---

## Sources of incompleteness


Real markets exhibit:
- stochastic volatility,
- jumps and discontinuities,
- trading constraints and transaction costs,
- discrete trading in time.

These features introduce risks that cannot be perfectly hedged.

---

## Consequences for pricing


In incomplete markets:
- replication arguments break down,
- prices are no longer unique,
- risk preferences and supply/demand matter.

Option prices reflect compensation for unhedgeable risks.

## Volatility as a non-traded risk


Volatility itself is not directly tradable:
- volatility risk cannot be eliminated by delta hedging,
- volatility risk premia emerge naturally,
- different agents may price volatility risk differently.

This motivates stochastic volatility and risk-premium models.

## Key takeaways


- Equity markets are incomplete in practice.
- Black–Scholes completeness is a theoretical idealization.
- Incompleteness justifies richer models and non-unique pricing.
