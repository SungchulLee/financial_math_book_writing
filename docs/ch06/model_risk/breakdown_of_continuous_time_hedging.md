# Breakdown of Continuous-Time Hedging

Replication assumes continuous trading, no costs, continuous paths, and correct model. Jumps, discrete trading, and model error break replication.

## What to remember

- Delta hedging is local; jumps invalidate small-move approximations.
- Discrete hedging error becomes large when gamma is large.
