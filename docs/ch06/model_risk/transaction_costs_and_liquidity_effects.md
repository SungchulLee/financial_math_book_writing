# Transaction Costs and Liquidity Effects

With proportional cost \(\lambda\), rebalancing \(\delta \theta\) shares costs about

\[
\lambda S |\delta\theta|.
\]


Since hedge turnover increases with gamma, costs can dominate near expiry.

## What to remember

- Frictions turn replication into an optimization problem.
- Costs scale with hedge turnover, hence with gamma.
