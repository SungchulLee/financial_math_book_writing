# Existence and Uniqueness of SDEs


## Setting


Consider the \(d\)-dimensional SDE driven by an \(m\)-dimensional Brownian motion:

\[
\boxed{
\mathrm{d}X_t^{i}
=
b^{i}(t,X_t)\,\mathrm{d}t
+
\sigma^{i\alpha}(t,X_t)\,\mathrm{d}W_t^{\alpha},
\qquad X_0=x\in\mathbb{R}^d.
}
\]


Equivalently,

\[
X_t^{i}
=
x^{i}
+
\int_0^t b^{i}(s,X_s)\,\mathrm{d}s
+
\int_0^t \sigma^{i\alpha}(s,X_s)\,\mathrm{d}W_s^{\alpha}.
\]

## Strong solution and pathwise uniqueness


### 1. Strong solution

A process \(X_t\) is a **strong solution** if it is adapted to the filtration generated by \(W\) (augmented) and satisfies the integral equation almost surely.

### 2. Pathwise uniqueness

We say **pathwise uniqueness** holds if whenever \(X_t\) and \(Y_t\) are two strong solutions on the same probability space with the same Brownian motion and same initial condition, then

\[
\boxed{
\mathbb{P}\left(X_t=Y_t \text{ for all } t\in[0,T]\right)=1
\quad \text{for all } T>0.
}
\]



A classical theorem states: **existence of a strong solution + pathwise uniqueness** implies uniqueness in the strong sense.

## Global Lipschitz and linear growth conditions


A standard sufficient condition for existence and uniqueness is:

### 1. (Lipschitz)

There exists \(L>0\) such that for all \(t\ge 0\) and \(x,y\in\mathbb{R}^d\),

\[
\boxed{
|b(t,x)-b(t,y)| + \|\sigma(t,x)-\sigma(t,y)\| \le L|x-y|.
}
\]



### 2. (Linear growth)

There exists \(K>0\) such that for all \(t\ge 0\) and \(x\in\mathbb{R}^d\),

\[
\boxed{
|b(t,x)|^2 + \|\sigma(t,x)\|^2 \le K(1+|x|^2).
}
\]



Here \(\|\cdot\|\) is any matrix norm compatible with the Euclidean norm.

---

## Theorem (existence and uniqueness)


Assume the Lipschitz and linear growth conditions. Then for each initial condition \(X_0=x\), there exists a unique strong solution \(\{X_t\}_{t\ge 0}\) to the SDE, and \(X_t\) has continuous sample paths.

---

## Proof idea (Picard iteration + Itô isometry)


One constructs successive approximations:

\[
X_t^{(0)} := x,
\]



\[
X_t^{(n+1)}
:=
x
+
\int_0^t b(s,X_s^{(n)})\,\mathrm{d}s
+
\int_0^t \sigma(s,X_s^{(n)})\,\mathrm{d}W_s.
\]


Using the Lipschitz condition, one estimates

\[
\mathbb{E}\left[\sup_{0\le s\le t}|X_s^{(n+1)}-X_s^{(n)}|^2\right]
\]


by a constant times an integral of

\[
\mathbb{E}\left[\sup_{0\le u\le s}|X_u^{(n)}-X_u^{(n-1)}|^2\right],
\]


and applies Grönwall-type arguments to show \(\{X^{(n)}\}\) is Cauchy in an appropriate space (typically \(L^2(\Omega;C([0,T];\mathbb{R}^d))\)). The limit is the strong solution. Pathwise uniqueness follows from a similar estimate applied to two solutions.

---

## Local existence and explosion times


If coefficients are only locally Lipschitz (not globally), one typically obtains a solution up to an explosion time \(\zeta\):

\[
\zeta := \lim_{n\to\infty} \tau_n,
\qquad
\tau_n := \inf\{t\ge 0: |X_t|\ge n\}.
\]


The solution exists on \([0,\zeta)\). Additional conditions (Lyapunov functions, dissipativity, etc.) can ensure \(\zeta=\infty\) almost surely (non-explosion).

## Weak solutions and weak uniqueness (preview)


A **weak solution** allows changing the underlying probability space and Brownian motion: one seeks a filtered space and processes \((X,W)\) satisfying the SDE in law.

- **Weak uniqueness** (uniqueness in law): the distribution of \(X\) is unique.
- Indirect methods: martingale problems and generators.

These notions become important when coefficients are irregular (e.g. merely measurable), where strong solutions may fail but weak solutions still exist.
