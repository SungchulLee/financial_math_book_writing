# Applications of Dynkin’s Formula


## Expected First Exit Time of Brownian Motion


Let

\[
dX_t = dW_t,\quad X_0=x\in(a,b),
\]


and

\[
\tau = \inf\{t\ge0 : X_t\notin(a,b)\}.
\]



Define

\[
u(x)=\mathbb E_x[\tau].
\]



## PDE from Dynkin’s Formula


Using Dynkin’s formula and boundary conditions,

\[
Lu(x)=-1,\quad u(a)=u(b)=0,
\]


where \(L=\frac12\frac{d^2}{dx^2}\).

Thus

\[
u''(x)=-2.
\]



## Solution


[Your full solution, unchanged]

## Interpretation


- Expected exit time is maximal at the midpoint
- Quadratic profile reflects diffusive scaling
