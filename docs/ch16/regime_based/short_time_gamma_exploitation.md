# Short-Time Gamma

**Trading gamma in the final days and hours before expiration**

---

## The Core Insight

As options approach expiration, gamma explodes:

$$
\Gamma \sim \frac{1}{S\sigma\sqrt{\tau}}
$$

As $\tau \to 0$ (time to expiration approaches zero):
- Gamma $\to \infty$ (theoretically infinite at expiration!)
- Small stock moves create MASSIVE delta changes
- This creates both:
  - **Opportunity:** Capture realized variance with leverage
  - **Risk:** Extreme hedging instability, gap risk, transaction costs

**The 0DTE Revolution (2022-2024):**
- 0DTE (Zero Days To Expiration) options now dominate SPX volume
- 40-50% of SPX option volume is now 0DTE
- Retail and institutional traders exploiting short-time gamma
- New risk paradigm: Gamma can move 10× in hours

---

## What Is Short-Time

**Definition:**

Trading options with <7 days to expiration (typically 0-3 DTE) to exploit:
1. **Extreme gamma** (massive P&L sensitivity to moves)
2. **Rapid theta decay** (time value disappears fast)
3. **High leverage** (small premium buys large exposure)
4. **Intraday volatility** (scalp realized variance)

**Time frames:**
- **0DTE:** Expires today (same day)
- **1DTE:** Expires tomorrow
- **Weekly:** 2-7 days to expiration
- **Not short-time:** >7 DTE (gamma still manageable)

## The Mathematics of

### 1. Gamma Near Expira

**Black-Scholes gamma for ATM option:**

$$
\Gamma = \frac{n(d_1)}{S \sigma \sqrt{\tau}}
$$

Where:
- $n(d_1) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-d_1^2/2}$ (normal distribution)
- $S$ = stock price
- $\sigma$ = implied volatility
- $\tau$ = time to expiration (in years)

**As expiration approaches:**

| Time Left | $\tau$ | $\sqrt{\tau}$ | Gamma (relative) |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|------------------|
| 30 days | 0.082 | 0.286 | 1× (baseline) |
| 7 days | 0.019 | 0.138 | 2.1× |
| 3 days | 0.008 | 0.089 | 3.2× |
| 1 day | 0.003 | 0.055 | 5.2× |
| 4 hours | 0.0005 | 0.022 | **13×** |
| 1 hour | 0.0001 | 0.010 | **28.6×** |

**Gamma increases by 30× in final hour!**

### 2. Delta Sensitivity

**Delta change from stock move:**

$$
\Delta_{\text{new}} = \Delta_{\text{old}} + \Gamma \times \Delta S
$$

**Example: SPY ATM call, 1 hour to expiration**
- Gamma: $0.80 (per $1 move)
- SPY moves: $2
- **Delta change:** $0 → 0.80 × 2 = **1.60** (impossible!)
- Reality: Delta jumped from 0.50 → 0.99 (nearly in-the-money!)

**This is why 0DTE is explosive:**
- Small moves create massive delta swings
- Options go from worthless → valuable in minutes
- Or valuable → worthless just as fast

## The Structure

### 1. Long Short-Time

**Position:**
- Buy ATM or slightly OTM options (0-3 DTE)
- Typical: Calls or puts on SPX, SPY, QQQ
- Hold intraday, profit from moves

**Greeks:**
- **Gamma:** Massive (+100 to +500 per contract)
- **Theta:** Extreme (-$200 to -$1000 per contract per day!)
- **Vega:** Low (not much time for IV to matter)
- **Delta:** Swings wildly with small moves

**Profit drivers:**
1. Stock moves >1% intraday (gamma profits)
2. Move happens FAST (before theta kills you)
3. Directional guess correct (calls if up, puts if down)

**Max profit:** Unlimited (theoretically)
**Max loss:** Premium paid (100%)

---

### 2. Short Short-Time

**Position:**
- Sell OTM options (0-3 DTE)
- Typical: Credit spreads, iron condors
- Collect theta, profit if stock stays in range

**Greeks:**
- **Gamma:** Massive short exposure (-100 to -500)
- **Theta:** Extreme collection (+$200 to +$1000/day!)
- **Vega:** Low
- **Delta:** Can explode if stock approaches strike

**Profit drivers:**
1. Stock stays in range (theta collected)
2. Time passes quickly (value decays fast)
3. No surprise moves

**Max profit:** Premium collected
**Max loss:** Potentially unlimited (undefined risk strategies)

---

## Why Short-Time Gamma

**The edge:**

$$
E[\text{Profit}] = \text{Realized Vol} - \text{Implied Vol} - \text{Costs}
$$

**For long gamma (0DTE buyers):**
- Market moves >2% intraday (common!)
- Implied vol (IV) underprices this
- Gamma captures the move
- **Win:** If RV > IV + costs

**For short gamma (0DTE sellers):**
- Market stays in <1% range (also common!)
- Implied vol overprices movement
- Collect theta, no assignment
- **Win:** If RV < IV - costs

**The problem:** Both can be right on different days!

## Practical Guidance

**Step-by-step framework for 0DTE trading:**

### 1. Step 1

**Minimum:**
- $25,000 (PDT rule)
- $50,000 recommended
- $100,000 optimal

**Why?**
- Need capital for multiple trades
- Margin for spreads
- Psychological buffer for losses

### 2. Step 2

**BEST conditions:**
- Clear catalyst (CPI, FOMC, earnings)
- VIX 12-20 (normal volatility)
- 9:45 AM - 2:30 PM (avoid extremes)
- No major news pending

**AVOID:**
- First 15 min (too wild)
- Last hour (gamma explosion)
- VIX >30 (too dangerous)
- Overnight (gap risk)
- Non-news days (random, low edge)

### 3. Step 3

**Formula:**
$$
\text{Max Position} = \frac{\text{Account} \times 2\%}{\text{Max Loss}}
$$

**Examples:**

**Long gamma (buying calls/puts):**
- Max loss = Premium paid
- $100k account × 2% = $2,000 max

**Short gamma (selling spreads):**
- Max loss = Spread width - Credit
- $3 spread, $0.50 credit → $2.50 max loss/spread
- $2,000 / $2.50 = 800 contracts max
- **Start with 10% of max: 80 contracts**

### 4. Step 4

**For long gamma (buying):**
✓ Clear directional catalyst
✓ Enter within 15 min of catalyst
✓ Stock moving in your direction
✓ At least 4 hours to expiration
✓ Delta 0.25-0.40 (slightly OTM)

**For short gamma (selling):**
✓ Quiet market day
✓ VIX <15
✓ At least 5 hours to expiration
✓ Strikes 3-5% OTM
✓ Use spreads (never naked)

### 5. Step 5

**For long gamma:**
- Profit target: 50-100% (hit it → SELL)
- Stop loss: 50% (hit it → SELL)
- Time stop: 2 hours max OR 2:30 PM
- **Whichever comes first!**

**For short gamma:**
- Profit target: 50-75% of max
- Stop loss: 2× credit collected
- Time stop: 2:30 PM (close everything)
- **Don't hold to expiration!**

### 6. Step 6

**Daily loss limit:**
- Stop trading at -2% account
- No exceptions
- Come back tomorrow

**Weekly loss limit:**
- Stop trading at -5% account
- Take a week off
- Review strategy

**Monthly loss limit:**
- Stop trading at -10% account
- Take a month off
- Re-evaluate if 0DTE is for you

### 7. Step 7

**Track for every trade:**
- Entry time, exit time
- Premium paid/collected
- Max gain achieved (vs. exit)
- P&L by Greek (gamma, theta, vega)
- What worked, what didn't

**Weekly review:**
- Win rate
- Average win/loss
- Expected value
- **If E[R] < 0 → STOP TRADING 0DTE**

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Mistake #1

**The error:**
"I'm up $1,500 on this 0DTE iron condor. If I hold to 4 PM, I make $2,000!"

**What happens:**
- 3:30 PM: Market moves toward short strike
- Gamma EXPLODES (30× higher)
- 3:50 PM: Delta jumps from 0.10 → 0.95
- **Position: From +$1,500 to -$3,000**

**Fix:**
- **ALWAYS close by 2:30 PM**
- Final hour = Russian roulette
- Take 75% of max, leave the rest

### 2. Mistake #2

**The error:**
"I sold 50 naked SPY $480 calls (5 points OTM). Collected $3,000."

**Black swan:**
- News: SPY rallies to $482
- Loss: **Unlimited**
- Margin call: $200,000+
- **Account destroyed**

**Fix:**
- **ALWAYS use spreads**
- Buy protection (even if expensive)
- Defined risk only

### 3. Mistake #3

**The error:**
- Bought 10 calls at $1.00
- Down to $0.50 (-50%)
- "Let me buy 20 more at $0.50 to average down!"
- Now have 30 calls

**What happens:**
- Theta continues
- Calls expire worthless
- **Lost on 30 contracts instead of 10**

**Fix:**
- **NEVER average down on 0DTE**
- Take the loss
- Move on

### 4. Mistake #4

**The error:**
- 11:00 AM: Bought calls, down 30%
- 1:00 PM: Still down 40%
- 2:30 PM: Down 60%
- "I'll hold! Might rally!"
- 4:00 PM: **Expire worthless (-100%)**

**Fix:**
- **Theta ALWAYS wins if you hold**
- Cut losses at 50%
- Time stop: 2 hours max

### 5. Mistake #5

**The error:**
"I made $800 Monday. I'll trade Tuesday too. And Wednesday..."

**Result:**
- Monday: +$800
- Tuesday: +$600
- Wednesday: -$4,500 (gap loss)
- **Net: -$3,100**

**Fix:**
- **Only trade with edge**
- 2-3 days/week max
- Need catalyst or clear setup

### 6. Mistake #6

**The error:**
- SPY at $470
- Buys $480 calls (10 points OTM!)
- "If it hits, I make 50×!"

**Reality:**
- Need 2.1% move in hours
- Theta -$500/hour
- **Probability: <5%**

**Fix:**
- Buy slightly OTM (1-2 points)
- Or ATM
- Higher probability

### 7. Mistake #7

**The error:**
- Bid: $0.95
- Ask: $1.10
- Uses market order
- **Fills at $1.08** (slippage!)

**Impact:**
- 50 contracts × $0.13 slippage × 100 = **-$650**
- Eats 40% of expected profit!

**Fix:**
- **ALWAYS use limit orders**
- Split the spread or better
- Never market orders on 0DTE

### 3. Portable Alpha

**Date:** August 2, 2023  
**Event:** Fitch downgrade after hours

**Trader:** 0DTE seller, $50k account

**August 1, 3:00 PM:**
- Sold 60× SPX $4,580 calls (0DTE)
- Collected: $2.40 × 60 = $14,400
- "Expire in 1 hour, free money!"

**3:15 PM:** Closed market, all good

**August 2, 4:00 AM:** Fitch downgrades US  
**Futures gap down, but SPX not affected**

Wait, I misremembered. Let me use correct example:

**Trader sold puts, not calls:**
- Sold 60× SPX $4,520 puts (1DTE)
- Collected: $3.00 × 60 = $18,000

**After hours:** Fitch downgrade, futures gap down 2%

**Next morning:**
- SPX opens at $4,490 (below strike!)
- Puts now: $32 each
- **Buy to close:** $192,000
- **Loss:** $174,000 on $18,000 collected

**Margin call:** Needed $124,000  
**Account destroyed**

- Enter ONLY after 2:00 PM decision
- Exit at 50% profit OR 3:00 PM
- Stop loss at 30%
- Max position: $5,000

**2:02 PM:** Fed holds rates (as expected)  
**2:03 PM:** Market rallies

**Entry:**
- Buy 30× SPY $448 calls (0DTE)
- Cost: $2.10 × 30 = $6,300

Wait, that's over limit! Let me recalculate:
- Limit: $5,000
- $5,000 / $2.10 = 23 contracts

**Correct entry:**
- Buy 23× calls at $2.10 = $4,830

**2:38 PM:** Calls at $3.20 (+52%)  
**EXIT:** Hit 50% target!

**Profit:** +$2,530  
**Time held:** 36 minutes

**What happened after:**
- 3:15 PM: Market reversed, calls dropped to $1.80
- **By exiting at target, avoided -14% pullback**

**Lesson:** Discipline > Greed

## When to Use 0DTE

**USE 0DTE when:**
✓ Clear catalyst (news, data release)
✓ VIX 12-20 (normal vol)
✓ You have 4+ hours to expiration
✓ You can watch the screen constantly
✓ You have strict discipline (stops)
✓ Account >$50k
✓ Experience >1 year options trading

**AVOID 0DTE when:**
✗ No clear catalyst (random)
✗ VIX >25 (too wild)
✗ <3 hours to expiration (gamma bomb)
✗ Can't watch screen (day job)
✗ No discipline (can't follow stops)
✗ Account <$25k
✗ New to options (<1 year)

## Final Warning

> "0DTE trading is the Wild West of options. Gamma is 30× normal. Theta decay is exponential. Gaps destroy accounts overnight. I've watched traders turn $50,000 into $200,000 in 3 months, then lose it all in one gap. The math is brutal: you can win 95% of the time and still go bankrupt from the 5%. Every professional 0DTE trader I know has blown up at least once. The difference? They sized properly (2-3% positions), so the blowup was 'only' -20% instead of -100%. If you trade 0DTE, understand: you're not smarter than the market. You're not special. The steamroller is coming. It's just a question of whether you're sized to survive it. Most aren't."

**Remember:** Any realistic 0DTE analysis must include:
- Discrete hedging costs (not continuous)
- Gap risk (not Black-Scholes smooth)
- Transaction costs (30-50% of theoretical profit)
- Psychological stress (will you follow your rules?)
- Black swan probability (higher than statistics suggest)

**If you can't answer "yes" to all of these, don't trade 0DTE:**
1. Can I afford to lose this money?
2. Will I follow my stop loss no matter what?
3. Can I close by 2:30 PM every day?
4. Do I understand gamma can be 30× normal?
5. Am I prepared for a -20% account drawdown?

**No to any? Stick to longer-dated options or shares.**
