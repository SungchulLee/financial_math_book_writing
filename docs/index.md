# Quantitative Finance with Python

Welcome! This book is written in Markdown and published with MkDocs + Material.

To run the code examples in this course, install the following packages that are not included in the standard Anaconda distribution:
```python
!pip install beautifulsoup4 cvxpy lxml mplfinance pandas_datareader requests selenium webdriver-manager yfinance
```

Some Python scripts are standalone and can be run without any dependencies.
Others require additional dependencies and must be executed from within the `python_code` folder, where those dependencies are provided.
