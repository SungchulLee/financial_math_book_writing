# Financial Math with Python

Welcome! This book is written in Markdown and published using MkDocs with the Material theme.

The foundational content of this book originates from my conversations with AI assistants. 
While I have reviewed and revised portions of the material, 
time constraints have prevented a comprehensive review of all content. 
I welcome your contributions in identifying and correcting errors through Git pull requests or email.

To run the code examples in this course, install the following packages that are not included in the standard Anaconda distribution:
```python
!pip install beautifulsoup4 cvxpy lxml mplfinance pandas_datareader requests selenium webdriver-manager yfinance
```

Some Python scripts are standalone and can be run without any dependencies.
Others require additional dependencies and must be executed from within the `python_code` folder, where those dependencies are provided.
