# Correlation and Systemic Risk


Credit risk is inherently correlated across firms and sectors. Ignoring **correlation and systemic risk** is a major source of model error, especially for portfolio credit products.

---

## Sources of correlation


Credit correlations arise from:
- macroeconomic shocks,
- sectoral dependencies,
- financial contagion and feedback loops.

These effects intensify during crises.

---

## Modeling correlation


Approaches include:
- copula-based default correlation,
- factor models for intensities,
- structural multi-firm asset models.

Each approach balances tractability and realism.

---

## Systemic risk


Systemic risk refers to:
- joint default events,
- cascading failures,
- breakdown of diversification.

Single-name models cannot capture these effects.

---

## Implications for pricing


Ignoring correlation leads to:
- underpricing of portfolio credit risk,
- severe losses in stress scenarios,
- misleading diversification benefits.

This was evident during the global financial crisis.

---

## Key takeaways


- Credit risk is strongly correlated.
- Systemic risk dominates in crises.
- Correlation modeling is unavoidable for portfolios.
