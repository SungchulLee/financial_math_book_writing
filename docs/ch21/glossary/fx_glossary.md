# Chapter 21: FX Glossary

This glossary provides definitions for key foreign exchange terminology used throughout Chapter 21. Terms are organized alphabetically for quick reference.

---

## A

**Annualized Premium/Discount**
The forward premium or discount expressed as a percentage per year, calculated as: $(F - S) / S \times (360 / t) \times 100\%$, where $t$ is days to maturity.

**Ask (Offer)**
The price at which a market maker is willing to sell the base currency. The higher of the two prices in a bid-ask quote.

---

## B

**Balassa-Samuelson Effect**
Economic theory explaining why countries with higher productivity growth tend to have appreciating real exchange rates, as tradeable sector productivity gains spill over into higher wages and prices in the non-tradeable sector.

**Base Currency**
The first currency in a currency pair quote. In EUR/USD, EUR is the base currency. One unit of base currency equals the quoted number of units of the quote (counter) currency.

**Basis (Cross-Currency Basis)**
The deviation from covered interest parity, measuring the additional cost (or benefit) of borrowing one currency via FX swaps relative to the interest rate differential. Typically expressed in basis points.

**Bid**
The price at which a market maker is willing to buy the base currency. The lower of the two prices in a bid-ask quote.

**Big Figure**
The first digits of an exchange rate quote that dealers typically omit. For EUR/USD at 1.0525, the "big figure" is 1.05.

---

## C

**Cable**
Market slang for GBP/USD, originating from the transatlantic cable used to transmit exchange rates between London and New York.

**Carry**
The interest rate differential between two currencies. Positive carry means earning more on the investment currency than paying on the funding currency.

**Carry Trade**
A strategy of borrowing in a low-interest-rate currency (funding currency) and investing in a high-interest-rate currency (target currency) to capture the interest rate differential.

**CIP (Covered Interest Parity)**
The no-arbitrage relationship stating that the forward premium/discount should equal the interest rate differential: $F/S = (1 + r_d)/(1 + r_f)$.

**CNH**
Chinese Yuan traded offshore (primarily Hong Kong), free from PBOC direct intervention. Contrast with CNY (onshore).

**CNY**
Chinese Yuan traded onshore within mainland China, subject to PBOC daily fixing and trading band.

**Cross Rate**
An exchange rate between two currencies neither of which is USD, derived from their respective USD rates. Example: EUR/JPY calculated from EUR/USD and USD/JPY.

---

## D

**Deliverable Forward**
A forward contract requiring physical exchange of currencies at maturity, as opposed to cash-settled NDFs.

**Dollar Smile**
The observation that USD tends to strengthen in both extreme optimism (strong US growth attracting capital) and extreme pessimism (flight to safety during global crises), weakening in moderate conditions.

---

## E

**Economic Exposure**
The impact of exchange rate movements on a firm's competitive position and future cash flows, beyond contractual exposures.

---

## F

**Far Leg**
The second (future) exchange in an FX swap, typically at a forward date, reversing the near leg transaction.

**Fixing**
An official or benchmark exchange rate published at a specific time, used for settlement of NDFs and other derivatives. Examples: WM/Reuters 4pm London fix, PBOC midpoint.

**Forward Points**
The difference between the forward rate and spot rate, typically quoted in pips. Forward = Spot + Forward Points.

**Forward Premium**
When the forward rate exceeds the spot rate, indicating the base currency trades at a premium for future delivery. Occurs when base currency interest rates are lower than quote currency rates.

**Forward Rate**
The exchange rate agreed today for a currency exchange at a specified future date, determined by interest rate differentials via CIP.

**Funding Currency**
A low-interest-rate currency borrowed to finance carry trade positions (e.g., JPY, CHF, historically EUR).

**FX Swap**
A simultaneous spot and forward transaction in opposite directions, used for funding, liquidity management, and rolling hedges.

---

## G

**G10 Currencies**
The ten most liquid major currencies: USD, EUR, JPY, GBP, AUD, CAD, CHF, NZD, NOK, SEK.

---

## H

**Hedge Ratio**
The proportion of an exposure hedged with derivatives, ranging from 0% (unhedged) to 100% (fully hedged).

---

## I

**Intervention**
Direct buying or selling of currency by a central bank to influence the exchange rate.

---

## L

**Layered Hedging**
A corporate hedging approach where exposures are hedged progressively over time (e.g., 75% at 12 months, 50% at 6 months, 25% at 3 months) to average out forward rates and reduce timing risk.

---

## M

**Mark-to-Market (MTM)**
The daily revaluation of open positions based on current market prices, determining unrealized profit or loss.

---

## N

**NDF (Non-Deliverable Forward)**
A cash-settled forward contract for restricted currencies where at maturity the parties exchange the USD-equivalent difference between the contracted rate and the fixing rate, without physical delivery of the restricted currency.

**Near Leg**
The first exchange in an FX swap, typically at spot settlement (T+2).

---

## O

**Outright Forward**
A standalone forward contract (as opposed to the forward leg of an FX swap).

**Overlay**
A derivative position added on top of an existing portfolio to modify currency, duration, or equity exposure without changing the underlying assets.

---

## P

**Pip (Point)**
The smallest standard price increment in FX, typically the fourth decimal place (0.0001) for most pairs, or second decimal place (0.01) for JPY pairs.

**PPP (Purchasing Power Parity)**
The theory that exchange rates should adjust to equalize the price of identical goods across countries, used as a long-term equilibrium valuation model.

**Premium (Forward)**
See Forward Premium.

---

## Q

**Quote Currency (Counter Currency)**
The second currency in a currency pair. In EUR/USD, USD is the quote currency.

---

## R

**REER (Real Effective Exchange Rate)**
A trade-weighted index of a currency's value against a basket of trading partners' currencies, adjusted for inflation differentials.

**Repatriation**
The conversion of foreign currency holdings back to domestic currency, often occurring during crises as investors bring capital home.

**Roll/Rollover**
Extending the maturity of a forward contract by closing the expiring position and opening a new one at a future date, typically via an FX swap.

---

## S

**Safe Haven Currency**
A currency that tends to appreciate during market stress due to flight-to-quality flows (e.g., JPY, CHF, USD).

**Spot Rate**
The current market exchange rate for immediate delivery (typically T+2 settlement).

**Swap Points**
The difference between the far leg and near leg rates in an FX swap, representing the interest rate differential for the swap period.

---

## T

**T+2 (T+1, T+0)**
Settlement convention indicating the number of business days after trade date. Spot FX settles T+2 (two business days after trade).

**Target Currency**
A high-interest-rate currency in which carry trade proceeds are invested (e.g., BRL, TRY, MXN, ZAR).

**Translation Exposure**
The accounting impact of exchange rate movements on the consolidation of foreign subsidiary financial statements.

**Transaction Exposure**
The FX risk on contractual cash flows denominated in foreign currency (receivables, payables).

**Triangular Arbitrage**
Exploiting pricing inconsistencies among three currency pairs (e.g., EUR/USD, USD/JPY, EUR/JPY) to generate risk-free profit.

---

## U

**UIP (Uncovered Interest Parity)**
The theory that expected spot rate changes should equal the interest rate differential: $E[\Delta S] = r_d - r_f$. Empirically, UIP frequently fails (forward premium puzzle).

---

## V

**Value Date**
The settlement date when currencies are actually exchanged. For spot transactions, this is T+2.

**VIX**
The CBOE Volatility Index measuring implied volatility of S&P 500 options, commonly used as a "fear gauge" and indicator for carry trade risk management (exit at VIX >30).

**Volatility Targeting**
A risk management approach that adjusts position sizes to maintain constant portfolio volatility, reducing exposure when realized volatility rises.

---

## W

**WM/Reuters Fix**
A benchmark exchange rate calculated at 4pm London time, widely used for portfolio valuation and index tracking.

---

## Key Formulas Quick Reference

**Covered Interest Parity:**
$$F = S \times \frac{1 + r_d \times t/360}{1 + r_f \times t/360}$$

**Forward Points:**
$$\text{Points} = (F - S) \times 10,000$$

**Carry Trade Return:**
$$\text{Return} = (r_{\text{high}} - r_{\text{low}}) + \Delta S$$

**Cross-Currency Basis:**
$$\text{Basis} = \frac{F - S}{S} \times \frac{360}{t} - (r_d - r_f)$$

**NDF Settlement:**
$$\text{Settlement} = \text{Notional} \times \frac{S_{\text{fix}} - F_{\text{NDF}}}{F_{\text{NDF}}}$$
