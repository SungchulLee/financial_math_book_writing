# Macro Regime Trades

**Macro regime trades** position portfolios according to the dominant economic environment—growth/recession and inflation/deflation—
allowing systematic allocation across asset classes as macro conditions evolve through predictable cycles.

---

## The Core Insight

**The fundamental idea:**

- Economies cycle through distinct regimes
- Each regime favors specific asset classes
- Transitions are observable in real-time
- Positioning shifts before consensus
- Risk premia change across regimes
- Correlation structures differ by regime

**Figure 1:** The four-quadrant macro regime framework showing asset class performance across growth/recession and inflation/deflation combinations, 
illustrating how optimal positioning shifts as economic conditions transition between regimes.

**You're essentially betting: "The current macro regime will persist long enough to profit, or transition predictably to an adjacent regime."**

## The Regime Framework

### 1. Growth/Inflation Matrix

**Four primary regimes:**

**Regime identification:**

| Regime | Growth | Inflation | Duration | Frequency |
|--------|--------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **Goldilocks** | ↑ High | ↓ Low | 40% of time | Most common |
| **Reflation** | ↑ Rising | ↑ Rising | 20% of time | Post-recession |
| **Stagflation** | ↓ Falling | ↑ High | 15% of time | Rare, painful |
| **Deflation** | ↓ Recession | ↓ Falling | 25% of time | Crisis periods |

**Key insight:** Most of the time (60-70%), we're in growth regimes (Goldilocks or Reflation). Stagflation is rare but devastating.

### 2. Leading Indicators

**Early regime signals:**

**Growth indicators (6-9 month lead):**

- ISM Manufacturing PMI (above/below 50)
- Yield curve shape (2s10s spread)
- Initial jobless claims trend
- CEO confidence surveys
- Credit impulse (loan growth acceleration)

**Inflation indicators (3-6 month lead):**

- Commodity prices (CRB Index)
- Wage growth acceleration
- Producer price index (PPI)
- Rent inflation
- Capacity utilization

**Transition signals:**

- Leading indicators diverge from coincident
- Policy shifts announced (Fed pivot)
- Yield curve inverts (recession warning)
- Commodity breakouts (inflation warning)

### 3. Regime Persistence

**How long do regimes last?**

**Historical analysis:**

- **Goldilocks:** 2-5 years (2003-2007, 2010-2018)
- **Reflation:** 1-2 years (2009-2010, 2020-2021)
- **Stagflation:** 6-18 months (1970s, 2022)
- **Deflation:** 6-12 months (2008-2009, 2020)

**Trading implications:**

- Position for current regime (months)
- Monitor for transitions (weekly)
- Don't fight the regime (patience)
- Shift gradually (not all-or-nothing)

## Regime-Specific Strategies

**Optimal positioning by regime:**

### 1. Goldilocks (Growth ↑, Inflation ↓)

**The sweet spot:**

**Characteristics:**

- GDP growth above trend (>2.5%)
- Inflation below target (<2%)
- Central banks accommodative
- Corporate margins expanding
- Low volatility (VIX < 15)
- Strong risk appetite

**Best performers:**

1. **Equities (especially growth/tech):**
      - S&P 500: +15-20% annualized
      - Nasdaq: +20-25% annualized
      - Low vol enables multiple expansion
      - Earnings growth + multiple expansion = double boost

2. **Credit (IG and HY):**
      - Spreads compress (HY: 300bps → 250bps)
      - Low default risk
      - Carry attractive vs. rates
      - Total return: 5-8%

3. **EM assets:**
      - Strong dollar not a headwind
      - Global growth supportive
      - Carry trades work
      - EM equities: +12-18%

**Avoid:**

- Commodities (weak without inflation)
- Gold (no fear, no inflation)
- Long-duration bonds (risk-off not priced in)
- Defensive sectors (utilities, staples underperform)

**Trade structure:**

$$
\text{Portfolio} = 60\% \text{ Equities} + 25\% \text{ Credit} + 10\% \text{ EM} + 5\% \text{ Cash}
$$

**Risk: Transition to reflation (inflation picks up) or deflation (growth slows).**

### 2. Reflation (Growth ↑, Inflation ↑)

**Post-recession recovery:**

**Characteristics:**

- GDP accelerating from low base
- Inflation rising but manageable (2-4%)
- Fiscal/monetary stimulus still active
- Pent-up demand releasing
- Commodity demand surging
- Value rotation begins

**Best performers:**

1. **Commodities:**
      - Oil: +30-50% in first year
      - Industrial metals (copper): +40-60%
      - Broad CRB Index: +20-30%
      - Inflation hedge + demand recovery

2. **Value equities:**
      - Financials (rising rates help margins)
      - Energy (commodity exposure)
      - Industrials (capex recovery)
      - Value outperforms growth by 5-10% annually

3. **Real assets:**
      - REITs (inflation protection)
      - Infrastructure
      - Farmland/Timberland
      - TIPS (breakeven inflation rises)

4. **Emerging markets:**
      - Commodity exporters (Brazil, Russia)
      - Beneficiaries of global recovery
      - Currencies strengthen
      - EM outperforms DM by 10%+

**Reduce:**

- Long-duration bonds (rates rising)
- Growth stocks (multiple compression)
- Defensive sectors
- Cash (inflation erodes value)

**Trade structure:**

$$
\text{Portfolio} = 40\% \text{ Equities (value tilt)} + 25\% \text{ Commodities} + 20\% \text{ EM} + 15\% \text{ Real Assets}
$$

**Risk: Inflation overheats → Stagflation, or growth stalls → back to Deflation.**

### 3. Stagflation (Growth ↓, Inflation ↑)

**The nightmare scenario:**

**Characteristics:**

- GDP slowing or negative
- Inflation elevated and sticky (>4%)
- Central banks in dilemma (hike = worse recession)
- Corporate margins compressed
- High unemployment + high prices
- Policy tools limited

**Best performers:**

1. **Commodities (still):**
      - Gold: +15-25% (inflation + uncertainty)
      - Energy: Supply constraints persist
      - Agriculture: Food price inflation
      - Hard assets preserve value

2. **Cash and short-term bonds:**
      - Negative real yields but less bad
      - High nominal yields (if Fed hiked)
      - Preserve capital
      - Liquidity for next regime

3. **Defensive equities:**
      - Staples, utilities, healthcare
      - Pricing power essential
      - Dividends support returns
      - Relative outperformance (less bad)

4. **Inflation-protected bonds:**
      - TIPS outperform nominal
      - Real yields still positive
      - Principal adjusts with CPI

**Avoid (everything else):**

- Cyclical equities (earnings collapse)
- Credit (defaults rise)
- Long-duration bonds (inflation kills)
- Growth stocks (multiple compression + earnings miss)
- EM (strong dollar + weak global growth)

**Trade structure:**

$$
\text{Portfolio} = 30\% \text{ Commodities} + 30\% \text{ Cash/ST Bonds} + 20\% \text{ Defensive Equities} + 20\% \text{ Gold}
$$

**Risk: Regime doesn't last long (6-12 months typically). Need to exit to next regime early.**

### 4. Deflation (Growth ↓, Inflation ↓)

**Recession and crisis:**

**Characteristics:**

- GDP contracting (negative quarters)
- Inflation falling (<1% or negative)
- Central banks easing aggressively
- Credit spreads blowing out
- High unemployment
- Deleveraging cycle

**Best performers:**

1. **Long-duration government bonds:**
      - 10Y/30Y Treasuries: +15-30% in crisis
      - Flight to quality
      - Yields collapse (rates → zero)
      - Negative correlation to equities

2. **Gold:**
      - Fear trade (VIX > 30)
      - Central bank easing
      - Currency debasement concerns
      - +10-20% typical

3. **Dollar (USD):**
      - Global reserve currency
      - Flight to safety
      - Funding currency unwinds
      - DXY: +5-15%

4. **High-quality credit (IG only):**
      - Spread tightening late in cycle
      - Short duration (1-3 year)
      - BBB/A rated or better
      - Avoid HY (defaults surge)

**Avoid:**

- Equities (down 20-50%)
- High-yield credit (spreads 500-1000bps)
- Commodities (demand collapse)
- EM (capital flight)
- Cyclicals, financials (largest drawdowns)

**Trade structure:**

$$
\text{Portfolio} = 50\% \text{ Long-Duration Treasuries} + 25\% \text{ Gold} + 15\% \text{ USD} + 10\% \text{ IG Credit (short)}
$$

**Risk: Central bank "bazooka" ends deflation fast → Reflation. Must pivot quickly when announced.**

## Transition Strategies

**Navigating regime changes:**

### 1. Recognizing Transitions

**Early warning system:**

**Growth inflection:**

- ISM crosses 50 (expanding) or 45 (contracting)
- Yield curve steepening (growth) or inverting (recession)
- Credit spreads tightening (growth) or widening (slowdown)
- Jobless claims 4-week average direction

**Inflation inflection:**

- Commodity prices breakout/breakdown
- CPI surprises (above/below consensus 3 months)
- Wage growth acceleration/deceleration
- Capacity utilization above 80% (inflation) or below 75% (deflation)

**Signal confirmation:**

- Need 2-3 indicators flipping
- Cross-check with Fed rhetoric
- Monitor market pricing (inflation breakevens, rate expectations)
- Look for technical breakouts in asset classes

### 2. Transitioning the Portfolio

**Shift gradually:**

**Phase 1 (First 2-4 weeks):**

- Reduce worst-performing regime exposures by 50%
- Add 25% to new regime winners
- Increase cash to 10-15% (buffer)
- Tighten stops on existing positions

**Phase 2 (Weeks 4-8):**

- Complete exit of old regime losers
- Build to 75% of target new regime exposure
- Monitor for confirmation or reversal
- Adjust position sizes based on confidence

**Phase 3 (Weeks 8-12):**

- Reach full target allocation
- Fine-tune within asset classes (sectors, duration)
- Reduce cash to normal 5%
- Set new regime monitoring framework

**Example (Goldilocks → Reflation):**

**Week 1-2:**

- Sell 50% growth tech (Nasdaq)
- Buy 25% commodities (oil, copper)
- Raise cash from 5% → 15%

**Week 4-6:**

- Sell remaining 50% tech
- Add value equities (financials, energy)
- Build commodity position to target
- Add TIPS

**Week 8-10:**

- Full reflation allocation reached
- Overweight value 60/40 vs. growth
- 25% commodities
- 15% EM

### 3. Hedging During Uncertainty

**When regime unclear:**

**Barbell strategy:**

- 40% positioned for current regime
- 40% positioned for most likely next regime
- 20% hedges (VIX calls, gold, Treasuries)

**Example (Late Goldilocks, unsure if Reflation or Deflation):**

- 40% equities (current regime)
- 20% commodities (reflation hedge)
- 20% long-duration bonds (deflation hedge)
- 10% gold (both regimes)
- 10% cash

**Cost:** Underperformance vs. concentrated bet, but avoid catastrophic loss if wrong.

## Greeks and Sensitivities

**Understanding regime portfolio dynamics:**

### 1. Beta to Growth (β_GDP)

**Growth sensitivity:**

$$
\beta_{\text{GDP}} = \frac{\text{Cov}(\text{Asset Return}, \text{GDP Growth})}{\text{Var}(\text{GDP Growth})}
$$

**By regime:**

| Asset Class | Goldilocks β | Reflation β | Stagflation β | Deflation β |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| Equities | +1.5 | +2.0 | -1.0 | -2.5 |
| Commodities | +0.5 | +2.5 | +1.0 | -2.0 |
| Bonds (long) | -0.8 | -1.5 | +0.5 | +2.0 |
| Gold | -0.3 | +0.5 | +1.2 | +1.5 |

**Implication:** Portfolio beta shifts dramatically across regimes. Reflation = maximum cyclical exposure. Deflation = maximum defensive.

### 2. Inflation Delta (Δ_π)

**Inflation exposure:**

$$
\Delta_{\pi} = \frac{\partial \text{Portfolio Value}}{\partial \text{Inflation Surprise}}
$$

**By asset class:**

- **Positive Δ_π:** Commodities (+2.5), TIPS (+1.5), Gold (+1.0)
- **Neutral Δ_π:** Equities (~0), Cash (0)
- **Negative Δ_π:** Bonds (-2.0), Growth stocks (-1.5)

**Regime targeting:**

- Stagflation: Want high positive Δ_π (commodities, gold, TIPS)
- Deflation: Want negative Δ_π (bonds benefit from falling inflation)
- Goldilocks: Δ_π ≈ 0 (don't care, no inflation pressure)

### 3. Volatility Exposure (Vega)

**Regime volatility patterns:**

**Historical VIX by regime:**

- Goldilocks: VIX 12-15 (calm)
- Reflation: VIX 15-20 (moderate)
- Stagflation: VIX 20-30 (elevated)
- Deflation: VIX 30-60 (crisis)

**Position adjustments:**

- Goldilocks: Sell volatility (premium collection)
- Stagflation/Deflation: Buy volatility (insurance)
- Use VIX percentile rank (> 75th = expensive, < 25th = cheap)

### 4. Correlation Dynamics (ρ)

**Regime-dependent correlations:**

**Stock-Bond correlation:**

- Goldilocks: ρ ≈ -0.4 (diversification works)
- Reflation: ρ ≈ +0.3 (both selloff as rates rise)
- Stagflation: ρ ≈ +0.6 (both suffer)
- Deflation: ρ ≈ -0.7 (strong negative, flight to safety)

**Trading implication:**

- Stagflation: 60/40 fails (both down)
- Deflation: 60/40 works (bonds offset equities)
- Adjust hedge ratios based on regime

## Implementation Details

**Practical execution of regime trades:**

### 1. Regime Identification Process

**Weekly monitoring dashboard:**

**Growth indicators:**

- [ ] ISM Manufacturing (target: >50 = growth)
- [ ] Yield curve 2s10s (target: >0 = growth)
- [ ] Initial claims 4-wk avg (target: <300K = growth)
- [ ] LEI (Leading Economic Index) direction
- [ ] S&P 500 earnings growth (yoy %)

**Inflation indicators:**

- [ ] CPI/Core CPI (target: <2% = low, >4% = high)
- [ ] PPI (leading CPI by 1-2 months)
- [ ] Commodity prices (CRB Index level)
- [ ] Wage growth (Average Hourly Earnings yoy%)
- [ ] Rent inflation (Owners' Equivalent Rent)

**Scoring system:**

- Assign each indicator: +1 (growth/inflation), 0 (neutral), -1 (contraction/deflation)
- Sum growth scores: > +2 = growth, < -2 = recession
- Sum inflation scores: > +2 = inflation, < -2 = deflation
- **Result: Four quadrant position**

### 2. Asset Allocation Targets

**Target weights by regime:**

**Goldilocks portfolio:**

```
Equities (growth tilt):     60%
  - S&P 500/Nasdaq:        45%

```

### 3. Rebalancing Rules

**Rebalance when:**

- Regime score shifts by ≥ 3 points
- Major policy announcement (Fed pivot)
- Regime duration exceeds historical average
- Portfolio drift > 10% from targets
- Black swan event (immediate crisis allocation)

**Rebalancing speed:**

- High conviction transition: 2-4 weeks
- Moderate conviction: 6-8 weeks
- Low conviction: Stay in current, add hedges

- Sector ETFs: XLE (Energy), XLF (Financials), XLP (Staples)
- Futures: ES (S&P), NQ (Nasdaq) for leverage

**Commodities:**

- ETFs: USO (Oil), GLD (Gold), DBC (Broad commodities)
- Futures: CL (Crude), GC (Gold), HG (Copper)
- Commodity stocks: Energy, mining equities (cheaper than futures roll)

**Bonds:**

## When It Works Best

**Optimal conditions for regime trading:**

### 1. Clear Regime Definition

**Strong signal characteristics:**

- 80%+ of indicators aligned
- Regime persists > 6 months already
- Policy clearly supportive
- Historical analogs exist (2003-2007 Goldilocks)
- Technical confirmation across assets

### 2. Regime Stability

**Long-lasting regimes allow compounding:**

- Goldilocks 2010-2018: 9-year run
- Reflation 2003-2007: 5-year run
- Allows full positioning without whipsaw
- Time to fine-tune allocations
- Confidence in mean reversion trades within regime

### 3. Early Identification

**First movers win:**

- Enter new regime first 3 months
- Assets not yet repriced
- Momentum builds over time
- Example: Identify reflation in March 2020 (COVID bottom), not September 2020

---

## When It Fails

**Regime trading challenges:**

### 1. Regime Ambiguity

**Mixed signals:**

- Growth indicators: 3 up, 3 down
- Inflation indicators: conflicting
- Fed unclear (data-dependent)
- Technical setups confused

**Result:**

- Whipsaw between allocations
- Transaction costs erode returns
- Psychological difficulty (constant change)
- Better to stay neutral (60/40) until clarity

### 2. Rapid Regime Shifts

**When transitions happen fast:**

- 2020: Goldilocks → Deflation (1 week)
- 2022: Reflation → Stagflation (6 weeks)
- Not enough time to reposition
- Suffer losses during transition
- Lag in recognizing shift

**Mitigation:**

- Always hold 10-20% hedges
- Use faster indicators (HY spreads, commodity momentum)
- Accept losses, reposition immediately
- Don't wait for confirmation (will be too late)

### 3. Policy Shocks

**Central bank surprises:**

- Unexpected rate hike/cut
- QE announcement (2020)
- Intervention (BOJ)
- Fiscal stimulus (COVID checks)

**Impact:**

- Regime extends beyond expectations
- "Deflation" never arrives (policy prevents)
- Goldilocks artificially prolonged
- Regime framework breaks temporarily

**Response:**

- Don't fight the Fed (policy > fundamentals)
- Adjust regime probabilities
- Extend time horizon (regime lasts longer)
- Reduce position sizes (uncertainty up)

---

## Common Mistakes

**Frequent errors in regime trading:**

### 1. Fighting the Regime

**The mistake:**

- Regime is clearly Reflation
- Investor thinks "inflation is temporary"
- Stays in Goldilocks allocation (tech heavy)
- Commodities surge, tech lags
- Portfolio underperforms

**Why it fails:**

- Regimes persist longer than expected
- Market reprices assets fully
- Fighting trend = losses
- Ego ("I know better") blocks adaptation

**Fix:**

- Follow the data, not your opinion
- Regime framework is descriptive, not predictive
- Accept you were wrong, shift allocation
- Track regime probabilities, not single forecast

### 2. Over-Trading Transitions

**The mistake:**

- Sees hint of regime shift
- Immediately rotates 100% of portfolio
- Regime doesn't shift (false signal)
- Rotates back
- Repeat

**Why it fails:**

- Transaction costs (1-2% round trip)
- Tax inefficiency (short-term gains)
- Psychological exhaustion
- Whipsaw losses compound

**Fix:**

- Require 3+ confirming indicators
- Transition over 4-8 weeks (gradual)
- Keep 20% in "neutral" assets (gold, cash)
- Maximum 2-3 regime shifts per year

### 3. Ignoring Diversification

**The mistake:**

- Regime is Reflation
- Goes 100% commodities
- Forgets about diversification
- Commodities crash 30% in sudden risk-off
- Portfolio destroyed

**Why it fails:**

- No regime lasts forever
- Sudden transitions happen
- Concentrated bets = huge drawdowns
- Recovery requires perfection (next regime bet)

**Fix:**

- Even in clear regime, diversify within theme
- Max 40% in any single asset class
- Always hold 10% cash + 10% gold (insurance)
- Target 60-70% alignment, not 100%

### 4. Lag in Recognition

**The mistake:**

- Data shows regime shifting (3 months of evidence)
- Investor waits for "confirmation" (6+ months)
- By then, assets fully repriced
- Enters at peak of regime
- Immediate reversal

**Why it fails:**

- Market is forward-looking (6-12 months)
- Waiting for certainty = too late
- Enter after move, suffer reversal
- Regime framework loses edge

**Fix:**

- Act on 3 confirming indicators (good enough)
- Accept uncertainty, size smaller if unsure
- Early positioning = maximum gain
- "Confirmation" is for losers; probabilities guide winners

---

## Risk Management Rules

### 1. Diversification Within Regime

**Never concentrate:**

$$
\text{Max Single Asset Class} = 40\%
$$

**Example (Reflation):**

- Commodities: 30% (not 100%)
- Equities: 40% (value + EM)
- Real assets: 20%
- Bonds: 10%

**Rationale:** Regime could shift suddenly, need buffer.

### 2. Hedge Allocation

**Permanent hedges:**

- 5-10% gold (works in Stagflation, Deflation)
- 5-10% long-duration Treasuries (Deflation protection)
- 5% cash (liquidity, opportunity fund)
- 2-5% VIX calls if VIX < 15 (cheap disaster insurance)

**Cost:** 1-2% annual drag in good times, saves 10-20% in bad times.

### 3. Rebalancing Discipline

**Quarterly rebalance:**

- Review regime indicators (monthly)
- Rebalance to targets quarterly (if drift > 5%)
- Exception: Regime shift requires immediate action
- Tax-loss harvest opportunistically

### 4. Monitoring System

**Daily:**

- Major economic releases (CPI, jobs, PMI)
- Central bank speeches
- VIX level (regime stress indicator)

**Weekly:**

- Update regime scorecard
- Review asset class performance
- Check portfolio drift

**Monthly:**

- Full regime assessment
- Calculate attribution (how much from regime vs. selection)
- Reassess regime probabilities for next 6 months

**Quarterly:**

- Formal rebalance
- Document regime thesis
- Review mistakes and learnings

## Real-World Examples

### 1. Goldilocks (2003-2007)

**Setup:**

- Post-dot-com recovery
- Fed low rates (1-5%)
- Inflation tame (2-3%)
- Earnings growth strong
- VIX < 15

**Optimal allocation:**

- 70% equities (S&P, Nasdaq)
- 20% credit (HY spreads compressed)
- 10% cash

**Performance:**

- S&P 500: +90% (2003-2007)
- HY credit: +45%
- Commodities: -10% (not in portfolio, correct)
- **Portfolio: ~75% cumulative (13%/year)**

**Lesson:** Stay fully invested in risk assets during Goldilocks. Don't rotate early to defensives.

### 2. Deflation (2008-2009)

**Setup:**

- Lehman collapse (Sept 2008)
- Credit freeze
- GDP falling -5% annualized
- Deflation fears (CPI negative)
- VIX 80

**Optimal allocation:**

- 60% long-duration Treasuries
- 20% gold
- 15% cash
- 5% defensive equities

**Performance:**

- 30Y Treasury: +40%
- Gold: +25%
- S&P 500: -40%
- **Regime portfolio: +15-20% while market crashed**

**Lesson:** Bonds and gold saved the day. Equities were catastrophic. Regime framework worked perfectly.

### 3. Reflation (2020-2021)

**Setup:**

- COVID recovery
- Massive fiscal stimulus ($5T)
- Fed QE infinity
- Pent-up demand
- Commodity shortage

**Optimal allocation:**

- 40% value equities (energy, financials, industrials)
- 30% commodities (oil, copper)
- 20% EM
- 10% TIPS

**Performance:**

- Commodities (CRB): +50%
- Value vs. Growth: +20% relative
- EM: +30%
- **Regime portfolio: +40-50%**

**Lesson:** Massive outperformance by correctly identifying Reflation early (Q2 2020, not Q4).

### 4. Stagflation (2022)

**Setup:**

- Inflation surging (9% CPI)
- Fed hiking aggressively (5%+)
- GDP negative (Q1, Q2)
- Earnings contracting
- Everything selling off

**Optimal allocation:**

- 30% commodities (energy, gold)
- 30% cash/ST bonds
- 20% defensive equities
- 20% TIPS

**Performance:**

- Commodities (energy): +40%
- S&P 500: -20%
- Nasdaq: -35%
- Bonds (TLT): -30%
- **Regime portfolio: +5-10% (relative win)**

**Lesson:** Everything lost except commodities and cash. Regime framework prevented catastrophic losses. Absolute returns bad, but relative returns saved capital.

## Practical Steps

**Step-by-step regime trade implementation:**

### 1. Regime Scorecard Setup

**Create tracking spreadsheet:**

**Growth indicators (weekly update):**

| Indicator | Current | Threshold | Signal |
|-----------|---------|-----------|--------|
| ISM Mfg | 52.1 | 50 | +1 (growth) |
| 2s10s spread | 0.35% | 0 | +1 (growth) |
| Init claims 4W | 215K | 300K | +1 (growth) |
| LEI MoM | +0.3% | 0% | +1 (growth) |
| S&P EPS growth | +8% | 0% | +1 (growth) |
| **Total** | | | **+5 (Growth)** |

**Inflation indicators:**

| Indicator | Current | Threshold | Signal |
|-----------|---------|-----------|--------|
| CPI YoY | 3.2% | 2%/4% | +1 (moderate) |
| PPI YoY | 2.8% | 2%/4% | 0 (neutral) |
| CRB Index | 285 | <250 / >300 | +1 (rising) |
| Wage growth | 4.5% | 3%/5% | +1 (rising) |
| Cap util | 78% | <75 / >80 | 0 (neutral) |
| **Total** | | | **+3 (Inflation)** |

**Result: Growth (+5) + Inflation (+3) = Reflation regime**

### 2. Portfolio Construction

**For Reflation regime:**

**Step 1: Liquidate old positions**

- Sell growth tech (QQQ)
- Exit long-duration bonds (TLT)
- Reduce cash to 10%

**Step 2: Enter new positions (Week 1-2)**

- Buy 15% commodities ETF (DBC)
- Buy 10% energy stocks (XLE)
- Buy 10% value ETF (VTV)

**Step 3: Build position (Week 3-4)**

- Add 10% copper/industrial metals
- Add 10% EM (EEM)
- Add 10% TIPS (TIP)

**Step 4: Final allocation (Week 5-6)**

- Reach target 40% equities (value)
- 30% commodities total
- 20% real assets
- 10% cash

### 3. Trade Execution

**Best practices:**

**Order types:**

- Use limit orders (avoid slippage)
- Break into 3-5 tranches (scale in)
- Execute during high liquidity (10am-3pm ET)
- Avoid month-end (window dressing affects pricing)

**Tax considerations:**

- Sell losers first (harvest losses)
- Hold winners > 1 year (long-term gains)
- Use tax-deferred accounts for high turnover
- Offset gains with losses when possible

### 4. Ongoing Monitoring

**Weekly routine:**

1. Update regime scorecard (15 minutes)
2. Check asset class performance vs. expectations
3. Review news for policy shifts
4. Adjust if regime score changes by ≥ 2 points

**Monthly review:**

1. Formal regime assessment (30 minutes)
2. Calculate attribution: Did regime work? Did selection work?
3. Rebalance if drift > 5%
4. Update thesis and probabilities

**Quarterly deep dive:**

1. Full regime reassessment (1 hour)
2. Review all indicators
3. Consider regime transition probabilities
4. Rebalance to targets
5. Document learnings (what worked, what didn't)

### 5. Transition Management

**When regime shifts (e.g., Reflation → Stagflation):**

**Phase 1 (Week 1):**

- Reduce worst-performing assets by 50%
  - Cut EM exposure (vulnerable in Stagflation)
  - Trim equities by 25%

**Phase 2 (Week 2-3):**

- Add Stagflation winners
  - Increase gold to 15%
  - Raise cash to 20%
  - Add defensive equities (staples)

**Phase 3 (Week 4-6):**

- Complete transition
  - Reach Stagflation target allocation
  - 30% commodities, 30% cash, 20% defensives
  - Monitor for stabilization or further shift

## Final Wisdom

> "Regime trading is not about predicting the future—it's about positioning for the present, then adapting as conditions evolve. The framework works because regimes persist long enough to profit, and transitions follow observable patterns. Most investors fail because they fight regimes or wait too long to adapt. Master regime identification, build disciplined rebalancing rules, and always hedge for uncertainty. The goal isn't perfection; it's consistently outperforming a static 60/40 by positioning with the macro wind, not against it."

**Key success factors:**

- Systematic regime identification (scorecard approach)
- Gradual transitions (4-8 weeks)
- Diversification within regimes (max 40% single asset)
- Permanent hedges (gold, cash, Treasuries)
- Quarterly discipline (rebalance, review, adapt)
- Humility (follow data, not ego)
